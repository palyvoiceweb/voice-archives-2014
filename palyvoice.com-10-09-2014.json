However, the construction was delayed, which benefits the team, according to\u00a0Head Coach Brandon Johnson.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s an huge advantage [to still have the pool],\" Johnson said. \"It would have been quite difficult to drive to different pools every day to practice.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe water polo players share Johnson's sentiments about having a home pool this year.\r\n\r\n\u201cHaving the pool this season is massive for the team,\u201d junior driver Ryan Reed said. \u201cWe all thought that it would be unavailable, and the thought of having to practice away from home brought a negative feeling to many of my teammates.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe team will need to adapt after graduating 14 seniors last year. However, the Vikings are not expecting those departures to have a huge effect on their level of play.\r\n\r\n\u201cThough losing 14 is tough, this year's squad has the potential to exceed what was accomplished last year,\u201dsenior captain Lukas Novak said. \u201cThe biggest challenge will be seeing if the team can build the same chemistry it did last year.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Novak, Paly is not the only team that lost key players.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery team besides Gunn [High School] will be weaker than it was in the previous year,\u201d Novak said.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of the Paly team, according to both Reed and Novak, is the bench depth. Only seven remaining players were on full varsity last season.\r\n\r\nEven after losing so many players, the Vikings still have high goals for the upcoming season.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur goal is to make CCS like we did last year,\u201d Johnson said.\r\n\r\nHowever,\u00a0Novak says the team's ability to succeed will depend on its ability to play together, making the level of success hard to predict.\r\n\r\nThe team's first game will be held against Monta Vista High School at 6:45 p.m. on Sept. 18 at home.","excerpt":"After making it to the Central Coast Section semi-finals last year, the Palo Alto High School boys' water polo team (24-6, 10-2) is hoping to have another successful season.","date":"2014-09-09 13:08:23","author":"Samuel Desr\u00e9","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/10686502_936996839650447_793134399_o.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"9845":"boys water polo","27720":"brandon johnson","27719":"lucas novak","12045":"season preview","10248":"wopo"}},{"id":73469,"title":"Preview: Apple of my i(Phone 6)","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/08\/preview-apple-of-my-iphone-6\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_73513\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/photo-12.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-73513\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/photo-12.jpg\" alt=\"The iPhone family might soon have a new member.

The iPhone 6 will also have\u00a0a thinner and longer body than the current 4.87 inches height and the 2.31 inches width\u00a0of the iPhone 5. In addition Apple is said to be releasing the iPhone 6 in two\u00a0different sizes, according to several technology rumor sites. The iWatch is also said to be part of\u00a0the announcement on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nThe Apple stock (AAPL) has recently been in decline due to the fact that celebrities\u2019 iCloud accounts were hacked and confidential pictures were released, but the release of a new phone iPhone could end the downward trend.\r\n\r\nMany students are enthusiastic about the possible release of a new iPhone.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe iPhone 6 sounds awesome,\u201d junior Anant Marur said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it has this sapphire crystal screen \u2026 and I saw this video about it and its impossible to scratch.

The administration wants to provide the maximum amount of support for seniors who need help for college essays.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kellerman, the idea to reinvent the ERC has been around since before the addition of Tutorial. Already, the first shipment of furniture has been set up.\r\n\r\nAlong with the new donated library furniture, the Writing Center has been set up for collaboration and discussion.

Diorio addressed the improved learning spaces, new teacher leadership positions and smaller class sizes.\r\n\r\nThe MAC and History\/Math building are two of several improvements to the Paly campus. The new additions received positive feedback from the public, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\nAccording to Diorio, the demolition of the gyms has been delayed due to budget issues. If the final price comes in at budget or below, the renovation process is set to start around Dec. 15. The library is also set to be renovated some time in the future.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the new features of the campus, there are new staff positions designed to help better the school community.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created some additional teacher leadership positions on campus called TOSAs \u2013 Teacher on Special Assignment,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cSome of our teacher leaders are focused on incorporating technology in the classrooms, helping and supporting teachers so that the lessons are more engaging.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother beneficial aspect is the smaller class sizes. Most freshmen and sophomore English courses have 19 to 20 students in each class, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe really wanted to lower those class size ratios so that our teachers are able to have more opportunities to personalize the learning for students and give them feedback in a more timely fashion,\u201d Diorio said.\r\n\r\nIn order to further enhance students\u2019 learning experiences, some of the classrooms have new furnishings.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen teachers are teaching \u2013 even if it\u2019s direct instruction \u2013 a lot of times, we find that [students] are moving maybe in the [new swivel] chairs, but their eyes are still focused on the teacher,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cSo just being able to move their body a little bit and that sensory motor integration is really important in terms of keeping them focused.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition to the presentation, Diorio held a Q&amp;A session for the parents. The PTSA also approved the new budget and bylaw changes at the meeting.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School Principal Kim Diorio is welcoming the 2014-15 school year with optimism and candor, according to comments she made at the first Parent Teacher Student Association General Association Meeting of the school year last night at Paly\u2019s Media Arts Center.

Photo by Cathy Rong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAfter many conflicts and issues with Spirit Dance\u00a0over\u00a0the past few years, the Associated Student Body at Palo Alto High School voted this week to change the format of the dances significantly for this year's Spirit Week.\r\n\r\nThe most important change to the Spirit Dances will be the number of dancers in each grade's dance. In previous years, students wishing to participate in the dance would audition, and from that group, five guys and five girls were chosen. This year, anyone will be allowed to sign up for their grade's dance, and the minimum number of participants will be five guys and five girls. However, there is no specified maximum, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1AK7YSINyJVLwji-zyfTxk47aUUyb8oM7JCIs6-oT90w\/edit?pli=1\">ASB's meeting minutes<\/a>, which are posted online daily.\r\n\r\nSimilar to Gunn High School's \"airbands\" dances, ASB hopes this new format will promote grade unity and inclusiveness, according to ASB President Claire Liu.\r\n<div

That's not the pressure. The pressure is getting the team to all be on the same page.\"\r\n\r\nLast year's team, which finished 6-6 overall, had its season cut short when it fell to the Saint Francis Lancers during the second round of league playoffs.\r\n\r\nAlong with Chryst, other graduated seniors\u00a0included Malcolm Davis, Keesean Johnson and Andrew Frick. Despite these departures, junior quarterback Oliver Svirsky is confident in his teammates, most notably on offense.\r\n\r\n\"Our current roster is solid,\" Svirsky said. \"We are very strong in our receiver and running back spots and overall I think we can do great things as a unit. Our coaching staff is very committed and very invested in making us a better team, setting us up to be successful.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Svirsky's top receivers this year, junior Eli Givens, echoed Svirsky's words, adding that he has a personal goal for the upcoming season. According to Halas, Givens is coming off a year where he was named All-League sophomore of the year.\r\n\r\n\"It's going to be a good season,\" Givens said. \"We've got great coaches and great teammates. My top goal is to get over 1,000 receiving yards this year.\"\r\n\r\nSvirsky and Givens, along with juniors Mikey Grandy, Tonga Latu and senior Jayshawn Puckett, are this year's team captains. With the current roster standing at 22 juniors compared to just nine seniors, Halas believes that the team is in need of some senior leadership, citing Puckett as a key veteran presence.\r\n\r\n\"We do have some seniors that we need to step up,\" Halas said. \"We need him to step up. There's a couple other seniors, but we are junior heavy. We need some senior leadership, we need somebody to step up from the senior class.\"\r\n\r\nOverall, Halas is eager to see if his team's success in practice will pay off during games.\r\n\r\n\"I'm looking forward to seeing these guys play,\" Halas said. \"We've got Sequoia, next week, so we'll see what we can do. I'm really curious to see our boys compete. They've been working hard, there's no doubt. We'll just see if we can put it all together.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings first home game is at 7 p.m. on Sept. 19 against the Archbishop Mitty Monarchs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"With the departure of long time head coach Earl Hansen and senior star quarterback Keller Chryst at the conclusion of last season's Central Coast Section playoff loss, The Palo Alto High School football team has their eyes set on lofty heights headed by a new core of leaders.
