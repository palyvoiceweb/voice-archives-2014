Photo by Jeanette Wong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTo-do list: Write an English essay. Hunt down Spirit Week outfit. Memorize Spanish vocabulary. Help with float building. Study for Monday morning math test. Sound familiar?\r\n\r\nThe combination of Spirit Week with the already present academic workload can make for an overwhelming experience.\r\n\r\nWhile I recognize the immense time and effort teachers put into creating lesson plans for us, I believe students should have a test-free, stress-free Spirit Week.\r\n\r\nSpirit Week is the one week that the entire student body (or the majority, at least) is involved in a single activity, and many can agree this event generates a sense of pride for both one\u2019s respective class and Palo Alto High School itself. By drawing out the competitiveness in all of us, Spirit Week gets us involved and encourages us to work together towards the common goal of securing bragging rights for being Spirit Week champions. It\u2019s a week for students to have fun and enjoy the high school experience.\r\n\r\nTests, projects, presentations and other major assignments can detach people from the full Spirit Week experience. Instead of being on the bleachers cheering for their class, some students may find themselves stressing over a test or scrambling to put the finishing touches on a project.\r\n\r\nOf course, wishing for a full week of school without any homework at all would be absurd. But in the spirit of Spirit Week, teachers should reserve the three class periods during that week for relatively less rigorous activities. By doing so, teachers will relieve students of the additional stress associated with tests and huge assignments.\r\n\r\nAs Pink Floyd sings, \u201cTeachers, leave them kids alone\u201d (at least during Spirit Week). Allow us to release our energy and scream our hearts out at the pep rallies without the thought of tests nagging at the back of our minds. With only four years at Paly, we should be able to optimize our time here by living it up during Spirit Week.\r\n\r\nSo I respectfully say, teachers, please show your Paly spirit by giving us space during Spirit Week.","excerpt":"Spirit Week generates a sense of pride for both one\u2019s respective class and Palo Alto High School itself.

According to Fu, the case was developed to make assistance in preventing sexual assault more readily available.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe [Lifeshel] designed the Whistl alongside an advocacy group called Pittsburgh Action Against Rape,\u201d Fu said. \u201cAs a teen, you may have trouble with confrontation. We prefer to talk it out over messengers, email, text. Sexual assault is a tough topic to be confrontational about. We want to engage your support network through the click of a button to make it easier for you to reach out and get the help you need right when you need it.\u201d\r\n\r\nFu has played a crucial role in the success of Lifeshel and its product.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy role is technically Chief Operating Officer,\u201d Fu said. \u201cThis means that I manage our teams to hit design deadlines and our ship date in July 2015. In addition to managing operations of the team, I also handle our finances, our intellectual property protection, as well as our corporate legal matters.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Fu, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/lifeshel\/whistl-a-smartphone-case-that-aims-to-deter-sexual?ref=nav_search\" target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter<\/a> campaign to raise enough money to launch the product has been successful so far, having raised over 50 percent of their goal of $70,000 in only a week.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe're hoping to drive momentum as more press is picking up our story,\u201d Fu said.\r\n\r\nFu believes that the product can\u00a0potentially benefit Paly students.\r\n\r\n\u201cPaly students for the most part fortunately live in a very safe part of the country,\u201d Fu said. \u201cThe Whistl helps both us and our parents feel safer about walking back home from school, going to parties and other aspects of life.\u201d\r\n\r\nFu also says that his time at Paly has helped shape his early success.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt Paly, there's a distinct feeling that the people that go here can change the world,\u201d Fu said. \u201cWe aren't afraid to talk about local, national or global issues. We don't hesitate to speak up and act. I think that's a unique facet of Paly culture that I'm proud of.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor more information about the product, check out Lifeshel's <a href=\"http:\/\/lifeshel.com\/\">website<\/a>.","excerpt":"A former Palo Alto High School student is involved in the kickstarting of his company Lifeshel's first product, Whistl: a smartphone case that aims to prevent sexual violence.","date":"2014-10-20 21:01:24","author":"Ido Gal","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/542db692af9e5c4227c9e0f0_Keychot-Render.62-1-clear.png","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"30319":"alan fu","29838":"alumnus","11978":"app","30322":"case","8793":"iphone","30321":"lifeshel","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","14283":"sexual assault","29623":"smartphone","30320":"whistl"}},{"id":76586,"title":"MAC grand opening day 1: Interviews","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/19\/mac-grand-opening-day-1-interviews\/","content":"The Paly Voice interviewed attendees of day 1 of the grand opening of Palo Alto High School's Media Arts Center.
