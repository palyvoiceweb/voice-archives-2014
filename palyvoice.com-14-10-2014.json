[{"id":75969,"title":"Opinion: Care about the PSAT","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/13\/opinion-care-about-the-psat\/","content":"This time of the year, all juniors are faced with the eternal question: to study for the Preliminary SAT\/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test\u00ae or not to study.\r\n\r\nBut what is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.collegeboard.org\/psat-nmsqt\" target=\"_blank\">PSAT\/NMSQT<\/a>? And why does it matter?\r\n\r\nBack when we were juniors, we also had these questions. The PSAT\/NMSQT is a national test that students across the nation take, typically during their junior year. After you take the test, you receive your results, and if you score in or above the 96th percentile you could be recognized as a semifinalist at the beginning of your senior year, after which you have to submit your scores from the SAT and an essay in order to find out if you are a National Merit Scholar. This year, juniors at Palo Alto High School will be taking the PSAT on Wednesday as a part of College and Career Awareness Day.\r\n\r\nSo, what should you do about the PSAT?\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>The PSAT is linked to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationalmerit.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Merit Scholarships<\/a> (as the name implies), which means if you become a finalist, you could win scholarship money.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>National Merit looks good. It\u2019s an opportunity to pad your college app with a national award. Colleges love having National Merit Scholars. Becoming a finalist means getting scholarships from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationalmerit.org\/Merit_Sponsor_Leaflet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">schools like Washington University in St. Louis and Tufts University<\/a>, and even being a semi-finalist looks good.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>People who have already taken the SAT have a huge headstart. \u00a0If you are one of those people, don\u2019t sweat it. If you aren\u2019t, keep reading.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>You don\u2019t have to go overboard if you want to get a good score. In Advisory, you should have received a practice PSAT packet. Do that. To be honest, over-practicing can get you too hyped up, and stressing can cause a lot of people to under-perform. Three practice PSATs are plenty.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>If you\u2019re like the majority of Paly students who haven\u2019t gotten started with SAT prep, the PSAT is a perfect benchmark. If you don\u2019t care about National Merit, just go into it without studying. It can give you a good idea of the areas you\u2019re going to need to focus on when it comes to the actual SAT. Don\u2019t be the kid who starts studying for the SAT the week before and expects a 2400.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>If you don\u2019t like your score, don\u2019t worry! The PSAT is just a preliminary score. Plenty of people we know got scores they didn\u2019t like, and ended up scoring 200 points higher on the real thing. By using the right materials (e.g. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Official-Study-Guide-Second-Edition\/dp\/0874478529\" target=\"_blank\">THE OFFICIAL BIG BLUE BOOK<\/a> and free prep questions on <a href=\"https:\/\/connection.naviance.com\/family-connection\/auth\/login\/?hsid=pahs\" target=\"_blank\">Naviance<\/a>) or by getting the right test prep (AJ tutoring anyone?), you can greatly improve your score. Remember, the SAT is not for everyone. Plenty of people don\u2019t do well on the SAT but get a great ACT score. When results come in, compare your PSAT score to your PLAN score from sophomore year and figure out which test you want to take.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>STUDY, BUT DON\u2019T STRESS. If you don\u2019t get National Merit, you don\u2019t get National Merit. Remember that only the top, top percentage of students in the nation will get it. Some top schools like Princeton and Stanford don't even care if you got National Merit or not, as long as you do well on the actual test<\/li>\r\n\t<li>If you do get National Merit, when you\u2019re a senior, you can feel special when you get a call slip that isn\u2019t for detention or being a hooligan.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nGood luck you crazy kids!","excerpt":"Confused and concerned about the relevance of the upcoming PSAT?

The two elected members will replace current board members Barb Mitchell and Dana Tom, and will serve on the School Board for the next four years.\r\nThe newly-elected members will join the board as it faces multiple issues concerning the community. One of these issues involves the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights cases regarding a mishandled bullying incident, where opinions differ among candidates on necessary actions. Another issue is the increasing number of students in the district, which faces the need for a 13th elementary school and even possibly a fourth middle school, however candidates unanimously agree on the need.\r\nMost importantly, the newly-elected members must focus on the emotional well-being of students in a competitive environment and the need to improve transparency to ensure that the community is well-informed and cooperative.\r\n\r\nScroll down below for a brief profile of each candidate.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Catherine Crystal Foster<\/strong> \u2014 Founder and Principal at Policy &amp; Advocacy Consulting, 48\r\n\r\nFoster believes in instituting good teachers, implementing world language as core subjects at a younger age, enhancing students' writing skills and opening new schools. She expresses the necessity to shrink the achievement gap through concrete goals and allowing for students to reach their highest potential without increasing pressure from the community. Contrary to other candidates, Foster believes citizens should not blame the current School Board for the controversy involving the Office of Civil Rights without knowing the complete details, but still agrees with other candidates that the School Board should not spend precious resources on the case.\r\n\r\n<b style=\"color: #111111;\">Boldest Idea:\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"color: #111111;\">Evaluating specific issues to ensure the best actions and goals the district can achieve\r\n<\/span><b>Endorsers you've heard of:\u00a0<\/b>U.S. Congresswoman\u00a0Anna Eshoo, State Senator Jerry Hill\r\n<b>Campaign Finance:\u00a0<\/b>$29,039\r\n<b>Education:\u00a0<\/b>B.A. in History, Yale University\r\nJ.D., Harvard Law School\r\n<b>Family:\u00a0<\/b>Husband Jon and two children attending Paly and Nueva Middle School\r\n<b>Community Involvement:\u00a0<\/b>Former Site Council member of Duveneck Elementary School\r\nFormer PTA Council Liaison\r\nFormer board member of Palo Alto Partners in Education (PiE)\r\nBoard member of Palo Alto Community Fund\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Gina Dalma\u00a0<\/strong>\u2014 Executive Director at Community LIFE Network, 34\r\n\r\nDalma is focused on creating a collaborative, connected and creative educational program in schools in order for students to not just adapt to the changing 21st century, but to thrive in it.

I am, personally, an avid fan of all boba drinks, having consumed over 80 of them since April.\r\n\r\nFirst things first, what is boba? Boba tea has many different names. Boba, PMT, pearl milk tea, bubble tea, tapioca milk tea or balls drink are all names that are frequently\u00a0used for this beverage. Boba and\u00a0PMT are the most commonly used, so I will be using that terminology for this blog.\r\n\r\nAccording to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sfgate.com\/food\/article\/Bubble-tea-The-fad-that-forgot-to-fade-5751614.php\">SFgate<\/a>, there are currently 75 PMT\u00a0shops in San Francisco, the East Bay and the Peninsula.

Photo by Alex Merkle-Raymond[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<em>Features:<\/em>\r\n\r\nVerde is one of the most commonly visited PMT places by Paly students. There is always a line, but the servers are very efficient and get even large orders done quickly. The small size, 22 ounces, at Verde is the larger size at most other PMT places, so it is the best bargain. They are also the only place with a \"tub,\" which is the largest size, 32 ounces, PMT available nearby.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons for this rating is because of the large variety of drinks Verde has available. Not only are\u00a0there around 30 milk tea flavors, but freeze blends and smoothies are also available. Pearls, jelly or bricks can be added to any order or not included at all, if that suits you. The pearls are large and chewy.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest issues I have with Verde is the inconsistency. Often, there is too much powder or too much sweetener, and other times, there is not enough, and it's like drinking a giant cup of milk. When Verde gets the proportions right, it's one of the best places available, but it can be risky.\r\n\r\nVerde also has meal options if the drink isn't filling enough for you, which range from chicken on a stick to cheesecake. Other upsides to Verde are its use of the super easy rewards system FIVESTARS and the availability of free WiFi.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Tapioca Express<\/b>\r\n\r\n<em>Overall rating: <\/em>5\/10\r\n\r\n<em>Student opinion:<\/em>\r\n\r\n\u201cI love the assortment,\" sophomore Victor Carlsson said. \"There are so many flavors to choose from.

There are so many flavors \u2013 even to the point that it can almost be a little overwhelming. When looking at the menu, the cost of pearls is not already added into the price on the sign, so it can be difficult when budgeting.\r\n\r\nThe pearls are very large and soft, allowing them to easily get stuck in the straw, which makes it very difficult to drink. They are also overly sweet and difficult to chew. Additionally, the tea flavor is very pungent, almost to the point of bitterness.\r\n\r\nThere are meal options, but\u00a0I have never seen anyone order any food whenever I go there, which is a little unsettling. The rewards system at Tapioca Express is a little complicated. Large drinks and small drinks are stamped separately, and you can only redeem a free drink of the same size as the 10 drinks you've already bought.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Jazen Tea\u00a0<\/b><b>(Served at Pho Hoa)<\/b>\r\n\r\n<em>Overall rating:<\/em>\u00a06\/10\r\n\r\n<em>Student opinion:<\/em>\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fun place, and I like that they have both noodles and PMT available,\" senior Kelly Shi said. \"Their PMT is really good and their noodles have a really good flavor.

The PMT offered only comes in three different flavors: Jasmine, Original and Apple Jack.\r\n\r\nJazen is one of the few places that uses syrup as a flavoring, and it's very obvious. There is often a ribbon of syrup along the inside the cup, which can make\u00a0the drink too sweet and causes the buyer to shake the drink around\u00a0to attain\u00a0a uniform sweetness.\r\n\r\nWhile Jazen specializes in adding fruit to the drinks, the pearls are still good: large and firm. The cups are larger and wider than at most PMT stores. They do not fit in the average cup holder or smaller hand.\r\n\r\nThe staff often waits for orders to build up before making them all, so it might take a while before the drinks are ready. Jazen uses a FIVESTARS \u00a0rewards system and also participates in various coupon sites.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Tea Era Cafe<\/b>\r\n\r\n<em>Overall rating:<\/em>\u00a07\/10\r\n\r\n<em>Student opinion:<\/em>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe service is kind of bad,\" freshman Hollie Chiao said. \"Some drinks I ordered were kind of sandy.

Photo by Alex Merkle-Raymond[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTea Era is a very small restaurant that is covered in handmade signs of drinks and rewards cards.\u00a0The menu is in Chinese and English and has some very unique flavors. Besides the usual honey, coconut and strawberry milk tea flavors, Tea Era has\u00a0Genmai brown rice, barley and mulberry to name a few.\r\n\r\nThe pearls are small and firm, making it very easy to drink many at a time. The powder never dissolves all the way into the drink and ends up coating the inside of the cup and the straw. Sometimes, there may even be a clump of powder that requires\u00a0vigorous shaking to break it up.\r\n\r\nEven though the tea might not be a very smooth texture, it does have lots of flavor and is rarely too sweet. The granule texture is a trademark of Tea Era that you quickly get used to and come to enjoy. I have gone many times and they have never messed up my order, which cannot be said of many other PMT places.\r\n\r\nThere can be a long line, and the service is not very fast for the large amount of staffers there. The rewards card is a stamp system. After buying 10 drinks, the next drink is free as long as there are no additions.","excerpt":"Each week, staff writer Alex Merkle-Raymond will take on the Pearl Milk Tea world, one cup at a time.

In addition, two students won statewide scholarships.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s exceptional,\u201d Woods said. \u201cThat\u2019s really, really unusual for any one school to have that much.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith talented resources in the department, Woods is looking forward to the year ahead with regards to ComedySportz.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery ComedySportz event that I\u2019ve attended \u2026 is just very clever and sharp and quick,\" Woods said. \"It\u2019s just a lot of fun to watch as an audience member, and it\u2019s really rewarding for the students participating in the improv.\u00a0I\u2019m really looking forward to the added element of having ComedySportz.\u201d","excerpt":"For the first year ever, the Palo Alto High School Theatre Department will partake in competitive improvisation as part of its newly-created ComedySportz team.","date":"2014-10-10 13:30:11","author":"Samuel Desr\u00e9","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_8527.jpg","categories":["Entertainment"],"tags":{"29694":"chris hinstorff","29692":"comedy sports","29691":"comedysportz","29693":"improv","29689":"kathleen woods","9159":"theater","9160":"theatre","29695":"thespian","29690":"zoe limbrick"}},{"id":75828,"title":"Highlights from Sen.

As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I'm here to tell you that I will not let that happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make no mistake, America's intelligence [agencies] are made up of thousands of overwhelmingly dedicated men and women who make enormous sacrifices to protect this nation. No one that I know in the senate or at this table wants to deprive our intelligence agencies of the tools that will actually make the world safer. But it's now clear that dragnet surveillance conflicts with core American values and doesn't make us\u00a0safer.\r\n\r\n\"The government ought to stop requiring American companies to participate in this suspicion-less collection of customers data and begin the process of rebuilding trust at home.\"\r\n\r\n<b><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Microsoft Brad Smith<\/span><\/b>\r\n\r\n\"Just as people would not put their money in a bank they don't trust, they will be reluctant to put their information in a data center or in a phone they don't trust.\"\r\n\r\n\"When trust is shattered, it needs to be rebuilt.\"\r\n\r\n\"[We need]\u00a0to go back to the fundamental personal rights that are at stake. I think all of us stand for a straightforward proposition: If you're a consumer or a company, you own your email, your text messages, your photos and all the content that you create. Even when you put your content in our data centers or the devices that we make, you still own it. You are entitled to the legal protection under our Constitution and our laws, and we will not rebuild trust until our own government recognizes that straightforward principle.\"\r\n\r\n<strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Executive Chairman of Google Eric Schmidt<\/span><\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"We want to thank you [Sen. Wyden] for being a phenomenal champion for technology [and] for jobs. And I think, and we probably all think, that you are a true patriot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank goodness that you [Sen. Wyden] led the fight against bulk surveillance, but things are getting worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think the simplest outcome is that we're going to end up breaking the Internet. What's going to happen is the government will ... eventually say, 'We want our own Internet in our own country because we want it to work our way. We don't want the NSA and other people in it.'\u00a0The cost of that is huge, in terms of knowledge, discovery, science, growth and jobs.\"\r\n\r\n<strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #000000;\">General Counsel of Facebook Colin Stretch<\/span><\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"One of the biggest challenges we're confronting as an industry is the inability for most of the world's population to access the Internet. ... Eighty percent\u00a0of the people without Internet access around the world are within range of a cell tower. The reason they do not have Internet access is because it costs too much. One of the big challenges for us as an industry is to bring technology to\u00a0address that problem, to get the rest of the world. Data localization takes us in exactly the wrong direction, simply because it costs too much money.\"\r\n\r\n\"From our perspective, the most profoundly disturbing [disclosures] was ... hacking, the sort of things we do see from some other countries that are involved with state-sponsored espionage. That put the relationship between the\u00a0industry and the U.S. government on a slightly different footing. ... What those disclosures\u00a0[hacking]\u00a0brought to light was there was this effort outside of what we all thought of as the appropriate legal process to attain user data. ... It placed renewed focus on our need to protect ourselves from these\u00a0sorts of unauthorized overseas attacks.\"\r\n\r\n<strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #000000;\">General Counsel of Dropbox Ramsey Homsany<\/span><\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"We need to be committed to providing good security and encryption for our users.\"\r\n\r\n\"Encryption is a critically important technology for everything we do and everything that happens on the Internet. Why would we start to hamper with it ... rather than wanting to develop great encryption and apply it so that consumers can have a lot of trust and faith in the fact that what they do store online is safe? There are many other ways for the government to get data when they're doing investigations ... which has been the legal norm for hundreds of years.\"\r\n\r\n<strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Partner of Greylock Partners John Lilly<\/span><\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"Most people want to follow the law.\u00a0Most people want to stay safe\u00a0... but [there's] this\u00a0bifurcation of citizenry and law enforcement and government, and we're getting a drumbeat of that, and that's increasingly the society we do not want.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"At a Senate Finance Committee Chairman's roundtable held yesterday in the Paly Big Gym, United States Sen.
