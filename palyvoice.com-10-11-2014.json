Some do not know what ACS is or exactly what it does.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_78393\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"400\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/photo1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-78393\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/photo1.jpg\" alt=\"photo\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> Adolescent Counseling Services is located both next to the Academic Resource Center in the Library and in the Tower Building. ACS provides counseling for students one-on-one and in groups. Photo by Lydia Barry.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThis is not right.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think people utilize [counseling] as much as they could,\" senior Sharissa Holopainen said. \"Many students fear it could be viewed as a weakness.\"\r\n\r\nWe as an educational community need to destigmatize counseling for students. Staff and students alike must begin to view counseling as a positive thing at our high school, not as a sign of weakness.\r\n\r\nSo let's set one thing straight: Going to counseling is completely normal.\r\n\r\nCounseling is not just for the mentally ill. According to the ACS <a href=\"http:\/\/paly.net\/adolescent-counseling-services\">webpage<\/a>, students can go to counseling for a range of reasons such as (but not limited to):\u00a0peer relationships, isolation, grief and loss, substance abuse, depression, cross-cultural issues, self esteem, academic stress, sexuality, parent\/child communication and anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"People often associate asking for help as a negative thing,\" senior Chloe Finley said. \"I think we should continue to stress the importance of asking for help when you need it and that talking about your problems with a counselor is very beneficial.\"\r\n\r\nCounseling can be in individual or group sessions. Counseling can be for when you're having a bad day, or when you get into a fight with your parents. It can be for when you fail a test, or even when you've just gotten great news and want someone to listen.\r\n\r\nNow that we've cleared all that up, let's talk about who else you can talk to on campus if you aren't inclined to attend ACS. At Paly, your Teacher Adviser and guidance counselor are trained to assist you if you ask them for help. They can refer you to someone to talk to, help you manage your stress or just be there to listen. Not to mention, your peers and teachers can often be an incredible support system, and we should not forget to rely on them in times of need. There are countless people at Paly who want to help you through whatever you're going through.\r\n\r\nCounseling is a great method for helping students that our school provides for free. Don't assume that if you weren't referred to the counselor or diagnosed as having a mental illness that counseling can't help you. Even going to visit the counselor to say hi and get acquainted is a great way to get comfortable with both the counselors and the general idea of counseling.\r\n\r\nEven if you are completely content with yourself and your life, encouraging others to go and being knowledgable about counseling services on campus can do a lot.\r\n\r\n\"I think the best way to stop the stigma is to get both students and adults who have struggled and who have used counseling to help them manage to come clean about it,\" junior Elana Rebitzer said. \"I know it's a really difficult topic for a lot of people, but if students see peers and respected adults saying 'I had a tough time, I was in your shoes, but going through counseling helped me to be where I am today' more students would be likely to try it.\"\r\n\r\nStudents: We are a community within ourselves. As much as we would like them to, often times parents and school staff simply do not understand what we go through like we do. It is our responsibility as well to look out for our peers. It is also important to not forget to look out for yourselves. Yes, we are in high school, but we are also in a crucial time in our lives. I implore you all to have some fun. Spend time doing things you love. Go out with your friends. Put your homework down and go for a walk. You are all important not just as students, but as people.\r\n\r\n<em>ACS is located both off the Quad in the library (next to the Academic Resource Center) and in the Tower Building on the first floor in room 5 1\/2.<\/em>\r\n\r\n<em style=\"color: #000000;\">A list of school and community resources are available on the\u00a0<a style=\"color: #31318c;\" title=\"PAUSD Health Services\" href=\"http:\/\/pausd.org\/parents\/services\/health\/index.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">PAUSD Health Services page<\/a>\u00a0and the\u00a0<a style=\"color: #31318c;\" title=\"PAUSD Counseling Services\" href=\"http:\/\/pausd.org\/parents\/services\/counseling\/\" target=\"_blank\">Counseling Services page<\/a>.

The team's offense will rely on them to make a\u00a0difference in their play, according to junior driver Ryan Reed.\r\n\r\nAccording to Reed, the team had a couple of tense games this season because of its inability to control the first quarter against weaker teams.\r\n\r\n\"We can challenge the best teams, but it's important that we work on putting weaker teams away in the first quarter,\" Reed said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Reed, one of the team's weaknesses this season is the players' tendency to play down to the level of their opponents. The team's toughest opponent will be Gunn (12-0), to whom the Vikings fell, 12-6, on Senior Night, according to Reed.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings, who are ranked second in leagues, will play Homestead High School, ranked seventh, today at 6:40 p.m in the first round of the De Anza Division League tournament.\r\n\r\nIf the Vikings win against the Mustangs, they will most likely go on to play against Mountain View High School, ranked third in leagues, for a place in the championship game at 4:20 p.m on Friday.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' water polo team (9-3) has high hopes as it gets ready for the De Anza League championships, which will take place this Thursday to Saturday at Gunn High School.","date":"2014-11-06 15:40:27","author":"Samuel Desr\u00e9","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/10683495_936995846317213_634147306_o1.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"9845":"boys water polo","15412":"de anza","15411":"leagues","32468":"ryan reed","9846":"water polo"}},{"id":78275,"title":"Club to host sMACdown","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/11\/06\/preview-club-to-host-smacdown\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School Super Smash Bros club will host a video gaming tournament for Paly, Gunn High School and Los Altos High School from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday in the Paly Media Arts Center.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_78279\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"400\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Smash-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-78279\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Smash-1.jpg\" alt=\"Smash Bros club members practice their skills during their lunchtime club  meetings.

The comedy mocks Silicon Valley culture by depicting a teenager working two internships.\r\n\r\nKientz directed Paly\u2019s first play this year, \u201cThe Stinky Cheese Man,\u201d but Kathleen Woods, the head of the Theatre Department, will be directing the play.\r\n\r\nWoods believes that the show will be a success and that the story will be easy for the audience to connect with.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think they [the audience] are going to be able to relate to it like crazy,\u201d Woods said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Palo Alto specific humor, and there\u2019s a lot of California Silicon Valley high tech humor. It\u2019s really a lot of fun.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Woods, the play did present several unexpected challenges due to script adaptations.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause we adapted the script and because we used improv, there have been challenges,\" Woods said. \"In fact, we are still reworking parts of it. It\u2019s very close. We\u2019re just working with the structure to modernize it but to keep the story clear.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Charlotte Moffatt, who works as a technician for the production, says the play has many unique aspects.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's [as] if you took Silicon Valley and mashed it up with 1500s Italian theatre and then added a lot of nonsense which gave birth to a comedy,\u201d Moffatt said.\r\n\r\nSeveral actors said that they have enjoyed the show and its production.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe show is very fun to work on,\u201d senior Cara Kienitz said. \u201cIt\u2019s much different than all the shows we have done recently because they were dramas and this ones just very lighthearted and fun.\u201d\r\n\r\nTickets are $10 for adults and $7 for seniors and students.

However, in light of Gunn's\u00a0recent <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/11\/04\/administration-offers-student-support-in-wake-of-gunn-student-death\/\" target=\"_blank\">tragedy<\/a>, senior defense specialist Kabria Dame says that she hopes that the competition does not get too out of hand.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want the competition between Gunn and Paly to overrule the volleyball spirit,\" Dame said. \"I also want people to come support the Gunn seniors because they deserve to be supported after their loss.\"\r\n\r\nRegardless, senior setter and right side Gillian Chryst says the team has the drive\u00a0to win this game against its rival.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re just really excited,\" Chryst said. \"We\u2019ve been playing these girls since the beginning of high school, so it\u2019s kind of bittersweet. They [Gunn] stole one early from us, and it was a close match even though we lost in three sets, but I definitely think that we can take them.\"\r\n\r\nChryst also said that this game is important in order to prove that this year's volleyball team, with a less impressive record than those of previous seasons, is still strong.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the last time we can show the school and everyone that we are a good team and that we all have talent,\u201d Chryst said.\r\n\r\nDame agreed, stressing the importance of Senior Night in that this match is the closing game of their years at Paly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is our last game in the Big Gym, and it\u2019s our Senior Night,\" Dame said. \"We need to win.\"\r\n\r\nThe match will start at 6:45 p.m., but there will be commemorations for the seven seniors beforehand.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls' volleyball team (2-8, 16-11) will play crosstown rival Gunn High School (3-7, 16-12) in its Senior Night at 6:45 p.m. on Thursday at home.
