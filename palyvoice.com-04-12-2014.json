That really helps in our first couple of tournaments.\"\r\n\r\nWith experienced players, Mullin is looking forward to a different game strategy.\r\n\r\n\"We'll be playing a little more uptempo this season,\" Mullin said. \"Playing defense the whole court, from one end to the other.

This year, the team will be stronger due to more seasoned players, according to senior center back Preston Kuppe.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that we will be better than last year because we have some good returning players,\u201d Kuppe said. \u201cThe biggest difference is that we have more experience this year, so hopefully that will work to our advantage.\u201d\r\n\r\nLast year, the team almost made the Central Coast Section playoffs, according to junior defensive midfielder Siddharth Srinivasan.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe had to beat or tie league champion Los Gatos on the last day of last season, and we conceded in the last minute to lose it,\u201d Srinivasan said. \u201cThis season, we hope to secure automatic qualification for CCS and fight for the league title.\u201d\r\n\r\nHowever, assistant coach Amir Malekpour says that it may be difficult because the team moved up to the De Anza League.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge for us this year since we moved up from the El Camino League,\u201d Malekpour said. \u201cWe are facing better teams, but I think we should do OK.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the team lost other key players besides seniors, according to Malekpour.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome of our starters aren\u2019t playing school [soccer] this year because of club,\u201d Malekpour said. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a change for us \u2014 looking for players to fill the spots.\u201d\r\n\r\nSrinivasan says that the team has a strong offense with certain key players.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have very fast and strong forwards, such as [junior] Dami Bolarinwa, [sophomore] Michel Ange-Siaba and [senior] Edward Chen, so we will look to play a more pressing defense,\" Srinivasan said.\r\n\r\nMalekpour agrees, emphasizing the overall strength of the team.\r\n\r\n\"We have a lot of players capable of stepping up,\u201d Malekpour said. \u201cMostly [seniors] Preston Kuppe and Wesley [Woo] will be the main two in defense and midfield.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boys\u2019 next game is their first pre-season game against Milpitas High School at 3:30 p.m., Dec. 1, at home.\r\n\r\n\u201cMilpitas has always been a very good opponent to play against because they're skillful yet also aggressive, but we know how they play overall, so hopefully we'll be able to use that against them to pull out a win,\u201d Kuppe said.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School\u2019s boys\u2019 soccer team is looking forward to a new season with experienced players after moving up a league.","date":"2014-11-30 13:32:21","author":"Amy Leung","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Screen-Shot-2014-11-28-at-6.08.39-PM.png","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"33524":"2014-15","33523":"2014-2015 season","8537":"Boys","9012":"preview","12045":"season preview","33522":"varsity soccer"}},{"id":79467,"title":"Paly students podium in jiu-jitsu championship","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/11\/27\/paly-students-podium-in-jiu-jitsu-championship\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_79476\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/10255765_10101755490340081_2407649469093751522_n-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-79476\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/10255765_10101755490340081_2407649469093751522_n-1.jpg\" alt=\"Freshman Ethan Rose prepares for his match with instructor Benji Silva.

Cao\u2019s paper was about \u201cusing DNA sequencing to obtain autoantibodies\u201d and the possible medical treatments that could be created from the sequencing, Cao said.\r\n\r\nThe competition required a thorough report, according to Cao.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was an 18-page report. You needed an abstract, an introduction, methods, conclusions, summary and you needed a bunch of pictures. The hardest part was getting the abstract done,\u201d Cao said.\r\n\r\nCao said\u00a0that the competition process was simple and mostly internet-based.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou put your report in, you have to mail some basic safety regulations if you do biology, like I did. You need to get approval from your mentor if you have one, but to make semifinals there\u2019s no person to person action,\u201d Cao said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_79193\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"450\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Richard.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-79193\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Richard.jpg\" alt=\"Senior Richard Cao is a semifinalist for his work with antibodies in a Stanford lab this summer.
