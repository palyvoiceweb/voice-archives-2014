Photos by Jeanette Wong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWalking around the Palo Alto High School campus, one cannot help but notice the plethora of custom clothing sported by the students.\r\n\r\nFrom tie-dyeing T-shirts to designing clothing to <em>dye<\/em> for, as technology continues to advance, it has become easier than ever to make customized attire to promote and unify groups.\r\n\r\nSites such as DesignAShirt, Zazzle and CustomInk enable people to design and order products from virtually anywhere. The clothing is also relatively easy and fast to make.\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Anna Lu who designed the Paly Debate team attire, it takes around 20 minutes to create a design and around two weeks to ship.\r\nThe availability of the latest T-shirt making processes seems to attract students.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more readily available and more people have noticed it and have gotten on that bandwagon of [making custom clothing for their teams]... over the last 16 years,\u201d Paly receptionist Vallen Queen said.\r\n\r\nNew methods for creating attire has simplified the overall process.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would say that because of computers, we\u2019re now able to print [shirts] directly from the computers which means that it\u2019s a lot easier and cheaper to print small quantities of T-shirts,\u201d said Randy Samuels, owner of Big Frog Custom T-Shirts &amp; More of Mountain View. \u201cIn the past, most shirts were made with screen printing, which means you have to use films and... separate each color in your image. Every shirt needs to [be individually made] which means it can be more time-consuming.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Samuels, the invention of new technology streamlines the price and decreases the cost of the production of a single T-shirt. Additionally, the larger the quantity of the order, the cheaper the price will be, according to Samuels.\r\n\r\nThe advanced process of T-shirt making opens doors for more opportunities of creative expression.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I was in high school the only clothes I ever made were crazy tie-dye shirts,\u201d Paly librarian Rachel Kellerman said. \u201cI thought the shirts [my son\u2019s classmate made a few years ago] were very clever and creative. I like the fact that anyone with a design idea could sell a shirt.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhether it may be sports teams such as volleyball, cross country and cheer, or Paly clubs like YCS-Interact, Speech and Debate and Robotics, communities at Paly are taking advantage of the tools offered by custom wear.\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Bethany Wong, custom clothing is an effective way for students to express their interests.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the case of my cross country sweatshirt, [it has a] somewhat sassy phrase on the back,\u201d Wong said. \u201cI\u2019ve struck up conversations while wearing it as I went around Palo Alto because people mention how they were also on cross country in high school or that they have heard of our school.\u201d\r\n\r\nCustom clothing also brings a sense of unity to groups,according to Wong.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt [custom clothing] is an excellent way to exhibit team or club unity on campus,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThere's also a certain coolness factor because each piece of custom clothing might be \u2018limited edition\u2019 and reminds you of the group of people in that club or sport.\u201d\r\n\r\nCustom clothing, however, can also create separate groups of unified students according to math teacher Suzanne Antink.\r\n\r\n\u201cTeen club T-shirts overall became a sort of \u2018separating\u2019 or divisive style among groups of students \u2014 a sort of labeling when none was needed,\u201d Antink said. \u201cHowever, as some clubs compete outside of school, like [for] Robotics, Debate, Scioly or Math, club members like to have a unifying team shirts.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice asked a group of 25 sophomores, juniors and seniors at Paly and found that the students from this sample size had up to four pieces and spent up to $100 a year on custom wear.\r\n\r\nAs clubs and sports have started, students are excited to obtain their custom wear to represent the activities they participate in.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to order a Speech and Debate sweater this year,\u201d senior Dan Su said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to represent the team I love.\u201d","excerpt":"From tie-dyeing T-shirts to designing clothing to dye for, as technology continues to advance, it has become easier than ever to make customized attire to promote and unify groups.","date":"2014-09-17 19:00:34","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-16-at-3.41.19-PM.png","categories":["Features","Spotlight"],"tags":{"28779":"big frog","8596":"clothes","11711":"club day","11337":"clubs","28776":"custom","28775":"custom ink","28780":"shirts","28781":"swag","28777":"t-shirt","28778":"tshirt"}},{"id":74012,"title":"Freshman class decides Spirit Week theme","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/17\/freshman-class-decides-spirit-week-theme\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_74020\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"630\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/DSC_01361.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-74020\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/DSC_01361.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_0136\" width=\"630\" height=\"418\" \/><\/a> Freshman Vice President Claire Billman and Student Activities Director Matt Hall hold up the Spirit Week schedule from two\u00a0years ago to show the range of themes that previous grades have come up with.

Well, here's a chance to check out your assumptions about the district.\"\r\n\r\nThe show is open to any type of question regarding the district from anyone in the community, according to Kappeler-Hurley.\r\n\r\n\"Anyone can call in and ask any questions that is\u00a0on their mind,\" Kappeler-Hurley said. \"It could be around curriculum, funding, bonds or anything of that nature. If they have a question for Dr. McGee that is something of broad interest, I would encourage someone to call in and ask.\"\r\n\r\nQuestions can be submitted via <a href=\"mailto:thurley@pausd.org\">email to Kappeler-Hurley<\/a> until Oct. 1. Call-in questions will be accepted during the show, however the phone number is yet to be released.\r\n\r\nAs this is the first call-in broadcast, Kappeler-Hurley is curious\u00a0to see the turnout, which she will take into account for future methods of communication.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to kind of test this the first time and see how the community reacts to this or enjoys this format,\" Kappeler-Hurley said. \"I'm hoping we can do two or three [live call-in shows] this year. But Dr. McGee is also open to doing things in a variety of ways, maybe community forums, tv shows or using video.\"\r\n\r\nMcGee looks forward to answering any questions or concerns as the star of the show.\r\n\r\n\"I am hoping to get to answer some really tough questions,\" McGee said. \"But overall, I am looking forward to some lively interaction.\"","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Unified School District will host a live call-in TV show featuring Supt.
