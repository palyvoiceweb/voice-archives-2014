However, due to the weather, the \"Mummy Game\" had to be canceled because it required the use of paper. The freshmen won the second game \"Pumpkin Bowling,\" and there was a three-way tie for second.\r\n\r\nAccording to students, Spirit Commissioners Emma Cole and Ariya Momeny handled the situation perfectly despite the difficulties brought upon by the rain.\r\n\r\n\u201cI felt that the planning committee did a good job adapting to the circumstances,\u201d sophomore Naveen Pai said. \u201cThings would have been too chaotic if the rally was moved to the gym.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly students thought that the rain added to Spirit Week and made it more exciting.\r\n\r\n\u201cI loved getting soaked with everyone during the rally while we cheered for our class,\u201d senior dance member Johnny Lee said.\r\n\r\nPai agrees with Lee.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a cool experience to be out in the rain with the rest of my class even if that meant one game had to be canceled,\"Pai said.\r\n\r\nThe rain stopped just in time for the floats to be displayed and the dancers to perform for students, parents and staff during the after-school rally.\r\n\r\n\u201cPaly's spirit was clearly noticeable, and the atmosphere was electric,\u201d Pai said.\r\n\r\nThe seniors won best dance and gained the privilege to perform their dance at the halftime of the Homecoming football game.\r\n\r\nCheck back to The Paly Voice for scores.","excerpt":"The rain did not stop Palo Alto High School students from competing in the final two rallies on Day Five of Spirit Week.","date":"2014-11-01 17:27:03","author":"Samuel Desr\u00e9","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/juniorconfetti.jpg","categories":["Spirit Week 2014"],"tags":[]},{"id":77962,"title":"Editorial: Spirit Week should be about unity","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/31\/editorial-spirit-week-should-be-about-unity\/","content":"This week, Palo Alto High School students are participating in the annual tradition of Spirit Week. This is the third year since the Associated Student Body introduced a new Spirit Week scoring policy in order to ensure fairness among classes and supposedly remove senior class-favoritism. With juniors currently in the lead and seniors trailing behind, the plausibility for a junior win during Spirit Week becomes more and more apparent. The tension between the classes has escalated to the point where the essence of Spirit Week is eclipsed.\r\n\r\nOver the past years, students have grown to become more preoccupied with earning the championship title rather than just having fun and enjoying the week. Both inter- and intra-class drama and petty disputes have become an all too familiar part of Spirit Week.\r\n\r\nASB\u2019s intentions to create a fairer Spirit Week are inherently good, but the reality of a non-senior win has perverted the true meaning behind Spirit Week \u2014 an event to bring classes together in support of Paly as a school. In recent years, instead of unifying the student body, this change has caused heightened tensions between classes, one especially evident this year between the junior and senior classes. Students\u2019 focus on winning Spirit Week has caused a rivalry to the extent that it generates an almost unhealthy competitiveness among the student body.\r\n\r\nRigged or not, Spirit Week should be about coming together as a community and having fun. Instead of pitting the classes against each other, ASB should incorporate joint-class activities and encourage cross-class collaboration. The fault at hand is not only of ASB, but of each and every student. The Paly Voice acknowledges and supports the competitive nature of Spirit Week; however, we believe that in order to preserve the integrity of the week, students should tone down the level of competitiveness. Under these newly revised scoring criteria, the student body as a whole should bring Spirit Week back to its roots: a time for togetherness and appreciation for Paly.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"As a heated Spirit Week comes to a close, The Paly Voice urges for the Paly community to bring Spirit Week back to its roots by promoting unity and Paly pride instead of unhealthy competition.","date":"2014-10-31 23:56:48","author":"The Paly Voice","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Screen-Shot-2014-10-31-at-11.57.40-PM.png","categories":["Editorial","Spotlight"],"tags":{"12701":"2014","19460":"2015","31768":"2016","31764":"appreciation","8496":"ASB","31767":"dispute","8654":"drama","8816":"junior","31766":"rivalry","31765":"roots","9119":"Spirit Week","27181":"spirit week 2014","31763":"togetherness","31762":"unity"}},{"id":77789,"title":"Video: Spirit Week Day Five","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/31\/video-spirit-week-day-five\/","content":"On the final day of this year's Spirit Week, the freshmen, sophomores and juniors decked out in white and green while the seniors wore camo.
