We made it to CCS and won CCS last year and we hope to do that again. Hopefully we\u2019ll make it to States again.\u201d\r\n\r\nSophomore Emily Hwang is expecting just as strong of a season as last year.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast year, especially as a freshman and since it was the first year of the team, I didn't really know what to expect at all,\u201d Hwang said. \u201cI think our team is almost or just as strong as it was last year so hopefully we can win CCS again and make it to States.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girls are scheduled to play Los Gatos at 3:00 p.m. Sept. 11 at Los Gatos High School for their season opener.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe beat Los Gatos last year so hopefully we can beat them again,\" Johnson said. \"I think there\u2019s a lot of excitement right now. Everyone is looking forward to the first tournament at Poplar Creek and then we\u2019re all looking forward to our first match, so hopefully it should go well.\"\r\n\r\nKnight is also ready for the team's first opener tournament.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur goal is to repeat the great season we had last year,\u201d Knight said. \u201cWhether we do or don't will remain to be seen, but the girls are working hard to give it their best.\u201d\r\n\r\nTheir first home match will be at 3:30 p.m. Sept. 25 against Gunn High School.","excerpt":"After placing first in the Central Coast Section and placing fourth in the California Interscholastic Federation State Championship last year, the Palo Alto High School girls' golf team hopes to bring its past success into the 2014 season.","date":"2014-09-07 22:54:13","author":"Claire Krugler","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/photo-4.jpg","categories":["Golf","Sports"],"tags":{"10012":"emily hwang","10175":"girls golf","8738":"Golf","25081":"knight","10010":"michelle xie","25082":"olivia johnson","25080":"paly girls golf","14521":"paly golf"}},{"id":73447,"title":"Principal greets PTSA with new changes","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/05\/principal-greets-ptsa-with-the-new-changes\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_73453\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"800\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/011a1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-73453 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/011a1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" \/><\/a> Principal Kim Diorio presents a motivational meme to parents at the first PTSA General Association Meeting of the 2014-15 school year.

Diorio addressed the improved learning spaces, new teacher leadership positions and smaller class sizes.\r\n\r\nThe MAC and History\/Math building are two of several improvements to the Paly campus. The new additions received positive feedback from the public, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\nAccording to Diorio, the demolition of the gyms has been delayed due to budget issues. If the final price comes in at budget or below, the renovation process is set to start around Dec. 15. The library is also set to be renovated some time in the future.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the new features of the campus, there are new staff positions designed to help better the school community.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created some additional teacher leadership positions on campus called TOSAs \u2013 Teacher on Special Assignment,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cSome of our teacher leaders are focused on incorporating technology in the classrooms, helping and supporting teachers so that the lessons are more engaging.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother beneficial aspect is the smaller class sizes. Most freshmen and sophomore English courses have 19 to 20 students in each class, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe really wanted to lower those class size ratios so that our teachers are able to have more opportunities to personalize the learning for students and give them feedback in a more timely fashion,\u201d Diorio said.\r\n\r\nIn order to further enhance students\u2019 learning experiences, some of the classrooms have new furnishings.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen teachers are teaching \u2013 even if it\u2019s direct instruction \u2013 a lot of times, we find that [students] are moving maybe in the [new swivel] chairs, but their eyes are still focused on the teacher,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cSo just being able to move their body a little bit and that sensory motor integration is really important in terms of keeping them focused.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition to the presentation, Diorio held a Q&amp;A session for the parents. The PTSA also approved the new budget and bylaw changes at the meeting.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School Principal Kim Diorio is welcoming the 2014-15 school year with optimism and candor, according to comments she made at the first Parent Teacher Student Association General Association Meeting of the school year last night at Paly\u2019s Media Arts Center.

Photo by Cathy Rong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAfter many conflicts and issues with Spirit Dance\u00a0over\u00a0the past few years, the Associated Student Body at Palo Alto High School voted this week to change the format of the dances significantly for this year's Spirit Week.\r\n\r\nThe most important change to the Spirit Dances will be the number of dancers in each grade's dance. In previous years, students wishing to participate in the dance would audition, and from that group, five guys and five girls were chosen. This year, anyone will be allowed to sign up for their grade's dance, and the minimum number of participants will be five guys and five girls. However, there is no specified maximum, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1AK7YSINyJVLwji-zyfTxk47aUUyb8oM7JCIs6-oT90w\/edit?pli=1\">ASB's meeting minutes<\/a>, which are

Photo by Josh Yuen.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe regular season kicks off at 7 p.m. tomorrow evening on the road against Sequoia High School.\r\n\r\nFirst-year head coach Jake Halas, a former assistant on Hansen's coaching staff, said that replacing Hansen has not been an issue of concern or as hard as people initially thought, citing his thrill for the start of the season as his No. 1 emotion.\r\n\r\n\"I'm more excited than anything,\" Halas said. \"I don't feel anxious or nervous to fill [the head coaching position]. That's not the pressure. The pressure is getting the team to all be on the same page.\"\r\n\r\nLast year's team, which finished 6-6 overall, had its season cut short when it fell to the Saint Francis Lancers during the second round of league playoffs.\r\n\r\nAlong with Chryst, other graduated seniors\u00a0included Malcolm Davis, Keesean Johnson and Andrew Frick. Despite these departures, junior quarterback Oliver Svirsky is confident in his teammates, most notably on offense.\r\n\r\n\"Our current roster is solid,\" Svirsky said. \"We are very strong in our receiver and running back spots and overall I think we can do great things as a unit. Our coaching staff is very committed and very invested in making us a better team, setting us up to be successful.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Svirsky's top receivers this year, junior Eli Givens, echoed Svirsky's words, adding that he has a personal goal for the upcoming season. According to Halas, Givens is coming off a year where he was named All-League sophomore of the year.\r\n\r\n\"It's going to be a good season,\" Givens said. \"We've got great coaches and great teammates. My top goal is to get over 1,000 receiving yards this year.\"\r\n\r\nSvirsky and Givens, along with juniors Mikey Grandy, Tonga Latu and senior Jayshawn Puckett, are this year's team captains. With the current roster standing at 22 juniors compared to just nine seniors, Halas believes that the team is in need of some senior leadership, citing Puckett as a key veteran presence.\r\n\r\n\"We do have some seniors that we need to step up,\" Halas said. \"We need him to step up. There's a couple other seniors, but we are junior heavy.

We\u2019re pasture raised, USDA [United States Department of Agriculture] certified organic, grass-fed [and] grass-finished.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut that's not all: the company's do-it-yourself attitude extends past just the ownership of the farm and livestock.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_73167\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"360\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/MG_2854.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-73167\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/MG_2854.jpg\" alt=\"_MG_2854\" width=\"360\" height=\"240\" \/><\/a> A Philadelphia Cheesesteak ($12) from Belcampo Meat Co.\u00a0 Belcampo opened this past summer in Town and Country. Photo by George Lu[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\u201cWe also own our processing facility, which we built from the ground up. \u00a0So we own the farm, the processing facility, and the locations \u2014 that sets us apart from most restaurants. Most restaurants are going to be getting [produce] from some other source ... so that definitely sets us apart from everyone else.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is neither the first nor only Belcampo.\u00a0 Other Belcampo locations can be found scattered throughout the Bay Area and Southern California, some of which offer sit-down dining.\r\n\r\nIncluded on the Belcampo menu are the pulled pork bun, braised lamb belly bun, chili, steak salad, meatball sandwich and smoked jalapeno and cheddar sausage, all of which fall somewhere between $5 and $13.\r\n\r\nI ordered the Philadelphia Cheesesteak, BBQ Chicken Bun, and Belcampo Hot Dog\u00a0student special. The cheese steak, one of the most expensive item on the take-out menu at $12, was phenomenal. \u00a0The meat was juicy and tender and the cheese perfectly melted, while the hoagie bun was lightly toasted with a softer center. \u00a0I especially loved the generous helping of meat in the sandwich, as well as the noticeable freshness of the vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe chicken bun and the hot dog, both parts of Belcampo\u2019s student special, were equally impressive.\u00a0\u00a0The meat tasted fresh and the bun in particular had a good ratio of meat to barbeque sauce, which had a perfect sweet richness to it. \u00a0The only drawback was the portion size \u2014 for $5, I had expected to get something a bit bigger than the hockey puck-sized sandwich. \u00a0Even as part of the student special, the chicken bun is comparable to Lulu\u2019s student special in terms of price, but only offers a fraction of the serving size, even though it also comes with a side of fries.\r\n\r\nThe hot dog deal seemed a better deal in terms of amount of food, and was only $6, but the food was a bit more plain \u2014 it really was just a hot dog, bun, and side of fries, which I found to be extremely average in crunchiness and general taste. \u00a0The lack of condiments available at the store was also a turn-off as I felt that they could have added some needed flavor to the fries.\r\n\r\nOverall, while Belcampo certainly offers high quality food, hungry high school students might avoid it for the small serving sizes. \u00a0However, Belcampo still remains an excellent alternative to the other restaurants of Town and Country and should not be judged too quickly.\u00a0 Perhaps the most exciting prospect for the majority of high schools students is a plan to rotate items on the student special in order to let students experience the entire menu.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Boettcher also says to look out for additions to the menu unique to Palo Alto.\r\n\r\n\u201cEventually we\u2019re going to put out some specials and some things that are a little bit off to the side, like kind of secret menu items,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_73170\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"395\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_28301.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-73170\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_28301.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2830\" width=\"395\" height=\"263\" \/><\/a> Belcampo Meat Co. offers not only quality takeout food, but also fresh cuts of meat. Photo by George Lu[\/caption]\r\n\r\nBoettcher also expressed the possibility of expanding the site to include catering.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have a great opportunity here in Silicon Valley to provide our food to different companies in the area for luncheons or for conferences and meetings, so we\u2019re definitely trying to reach out to them at some point once we get the catering side of Belcampo up and running.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the moment, however, he said that Belcampo Palo Alto is focused on simply getting more exposure.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe definitely want to get our name out there and let people know that we\u2019re here, that we\u2019re providing a great service [and] a great quality product,\u201d Boettcher said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"At first glance, you would probably not guess that Belcampo Meat Co. in the Town and Country Shopping Center offered more than most butcher shops.
