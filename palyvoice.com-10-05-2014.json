Many Palo Alto High School students plan to put on their cowboys boots and kick off country concert season with Tim McGraw at 7 p.m. on May 10 at Shoreline Amphitheatre. Three-time Grammy award winner McGraw will be accompanied by his concert openers, Cassadee Pope and Kip Moore.\r\n\r\nMcGraw entered the music industry in the early 1990s and is still going strong.

Hot-hitting junior outfielder Phil Lewis went 3-4 in Tuesday's game raising his season average to .423. \u00a0The Vikings look to follow Lewis' example by executing in the same manner that they have in their most recent three-game winning streak.\r\n\r\n\"We need to execute and stick to our game plan,\" Lewis said.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Vikings did pile up nine hits in Tuesday's victory, a large portion of their offensive success can be attributed to the sloppy defense of the Charges, which accounted for four errors.\r\n\r\nDepending on the outcome of today's contest, the Vikings will either play Friday 4 p.m. at Wilcox or 4 p.m.\u00a0next Tuesday at a location to be determined.

Photo by Gavin Libbey.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWith less than a month until graduation, who <em>really<\/em> wants to study for that calculus test second period tomorrow? As wave after wave of senioritis sweeps the school it doesn't seem so ridiculous to ditch sixth period to go to the beach or take the train up to the city. After all, you're in college, so there's nothing to worry about, right?\r\n\r\nWell, maybe.\r\n\r\nIf you're like me and falling off the academic bandwagon possibly a little <em>too<\/em>\u00a0hard, check out these super fun tips and tricks to hold your senioritis at bay because, hey, nobody likes being rescinded.\r\n\r\nTIP NUMBER ONE: Study outside. Next time you're headed to the park to work on your tan, grab a textbook on your way out the door. Got a 5th period prep? Head out to the Quad with some homework. Now you can work on that summer glow AND learn about biology. Multi-tasking at its finest.\r\n\r\nTIP NUMBER TWO: Make a calendar for yourself. Sure, maybe you're headed to Santa Cruz Wednesday afternoon, but that's no reason you shouldn't do your Spanish homework on Thursday. If you set aside time to work and time for fun, you'll feel a lot less guilty about slacking off one day if you know you'll have time to write that essay the next.\r\n\r\nTIP NUMBER THREE: Reward yourself for being productive. That may mean a Chipotle run, a fresh batch of chocolate-chip cookies or a new pair of shoes, whatever works for you. Maybe reviewing for a quiz means a scoop of ice cream while finally turning in that eight page paper merits a whole banana split.\r\n\r\nTIP NUMBER FOUR: Find a study buddy. Work is more fun with friends, everyone knows that. Pretty soon you'll be looking at each AB Calc review assignment as an excuse to hang out with that cute boy who sits across the room from you, and who doesn't want that?\r\n\r\nTIP NUMBER FIVE: Everything in moderation. For some people, senioritis is partying six nights a week, while for others symptoms include nine hour long Netflix marathons. Try cutting that in half (three parties a week is nothing to shake a stick at...) and spend all your new free time catching up on those 80 pages of AP English reading.\r\n\r\nSo go ahead, skip 3rd period tomorrow, and the next day and the day after that. But really, with four weeks left of school make sure to drop by Paly at least once or twice before graduation.","excerpt":"Check out these super fun tips and tricks to hold your senioritis at bay because, hey, nobody likes being rescinded.","date":"2014-05-06 22:01:46","author":"Paige Esterly","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_0554.jpg","categories":["Opinion"],"tags":[]},{"id":71416,"title":"Paly student hit by car on route to school","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/06\/paly-student-hit-by-car-on-route-to-school\/","content":"A Palo Alto High School student was hit by a car around 8:15 a.m. on route to campus this morning at the intersection of Churchill Avenue and Castilleja Avenue.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">According to an email sent out after the incident by Dean of Students Craig Tuana to Paly faculty, the student, whose injuries were not serious, was taken to the hospital by her parents as a precaution.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_71458\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"476\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/street.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-71458\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/street.jpg\" alt=\"The intersection of Churchill Avenue and Castilleja Avenue during hours while students are in class.

Photo by Callie Walker.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWith Advanced Placement tests are right around the corner, many Palo Alto High School juniors are likely wondering how they should prepare for their first round of AP testing. Having taken AP tests last year, the Voice's own Jared Schwartz and Becca Raffel offer their two cents on advice to prepare, and several other seniors as well as AP U.S. History teacher Jack Bungarden join the conversation.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, many people greatly overestimate the need to frantically prepare for these examinations, and\u00a0they forget one crucial element: they\u00a0have been preparing for the exam all year.\r\n\r\nWhy did you read every chapter of <em>American Pageant<\/em>? And learn how to use a voice recorder in Spanish? And diligently participate in all the biology labs?\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is, AP tests are made to reflect\u00a0what you have learned all year, not how much content you can cover in the next few days. Staying focused all year is crucial to success on the tests, according to senior Sarah Ohlson.\r\n\r\n\"Your teachers prepared you well throughout the year and as long as you stayed focused first semester you will do well second semester,\" Ohlson said.\r\n\r\nDon't get us wrong \u2013 a little spot review on areas that you might have forgotten is a great plan, but there is no need to go overboard with it. AP U.S. History teacher Jack Bungarden addresses the importance of reviewing.\r\n\r\n\"Study,\" Bungarden said. \"Go to review sessions, review your notes, go back and look at class materials, review the stuff you learned back in first semester. \u00a0Take some practice exams.\"\r\n\r\nPurchasing an AP practice booklet can also be beneficial, according to senior Jack Shapiro.\r\n\r\n\"It's really important to buy an AP test prep book if you can,\" Shapiro said. \"They have lots of tips on what problems you'll find and face and what you should review. \u00a0It's definitely worth it to get one to at least practice.\"\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of AP testing that is overlooked is the huge curve on the test. Depending on what AP class you're in, chances are that you have been taking simulated AP tests all year and have been receiving your raw grades on them. On the AP test, that C you have could\u00a0turn into a 5.\r\n\r\n<em>Three suggested\u00a0steps to dominating the test:<\/em>\r\n\r\n1. Pick out the topics that you have struggled with or haven't seen in a while. Make flashcards or have a friend explain them to you.\r\n\r\n2. Briefly skim over all the other material to remind yourself how much you know.\r\n\r\n3. Relax, get a good night's sleep and enter the test with confidence! \"Always choose sleep over study,\" senior Anthony Lim said.\r\n\r\nAll in all, we would like to stress the importance of not stressing about the tests. Sure, do some review and make sure you know your stuff, but\u00a0getting worked up about the tests is neither necessary nor beneficial.\r\n\r\n\"Take it easy and relax about it, it's not a big deal,\" senior Jonathan Mackris said. \"Paly prepares you well for the AP's.\"","excerpt":"With Advanced Placement tests are right around the corner, many Palo Alto High School juniors are likely wondering how they should prepare for their first <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/04\/how-to-prepare-for-ap-testing\/#more-'\" class=\"more-link\">more &raquo;<\/a>","date":"2014-05-04 21:21:50","author":"Becca Raffel","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/Screen-shot-2014-04-29-at-1.07.21-PM.png","categories":["Opinion"],"tags":[]}]
