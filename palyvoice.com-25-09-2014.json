The distinctive change in glass exterior walls will allow natural light, something that is absent in the current library, according to Librarian Rachel Kellerman. \"I'm most looking forward to the natural lighting,\" Kellerman said. \"We're trying to be as green as possible in the design, and this is a big part of that.\" Illustration\u00a0courtesy of DLM Architecture.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nBond Program Manager Bob Golton will present revised conceptual designs of the Library Renovation Project for Palo Alto High School at 9:35 p.m. tonight at the Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education meeting.\r\n\r\nThe design of the\u00a0new library includes a renovation of the entire 500 building, moving the Guidance Office as well as the College and Career Center to create a 'Campus Hub' of learning at Paly, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/pausd.org\/community\/board\/downloads\/brd_packet\/item_013.pdf\">meeting agenda<\/a>.\r\n\r\nLibrarian Rachel Kellerman explained that\u00a0the renovated building will promote a center for various student activities at the core of the campus.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_74577\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"412\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-20-at-9.32.16-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-74577 \" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-20-at-9.32.16-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-09-20 at 9.32.16 PM\" width=\"412\" height=\"405\" \/><\/a> The proposed library plan will include collaboration rooms as well as a 'maker space' to promote innovative learning.

The students activities office will also be here, which is great because it will go directly out to the Quad where they do a lot of activities. There will also be a maker space \u00a0in the back that teachers can book online for their classes, so that will be an interesting work space where students and teachers can come together in this facility.\"\r\n\r\nThe building will be separated by\u00a0glass walls on the interior and the exterior to allow natural light\u00a0into the building and long views out onto the Quad. The library will also include an upper level mezzanine and collaboration spaces for both students and teachers.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kellerman, the library design was developed after extensive research to provide for future demands.\r\n\r\n\"We've been working on the designs for a couple of years,\" Kellerman said. \"It's very well researched. We've looked at many libraries all the way from high school to colleges to public libraries to make sure we have everything we need not necessarily now, but moving forward into the future.\"\r\n\r\nThe board will also discuss the proposed project budget and the authorization to proceed with schematic design, which the Bond Program plans to propose\u00a0in December 2014 or January 2015. The overall expense of this project adds up to $9.35 million, which will come from the Strongs Schools Bond passed in June 2008.\r\n\r\nAccording to Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson, the library is set to move into the 700 building before\u00a0the planned 13 month-long construction begins in June 2016.\r\n\r\n\"Most likely, the library will be moved to the 700 building,\" Berkson\u00a0said. \"We'll have to wait for the gym to be done because PE [physical education] is moving there now.\"\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_74584\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"437\"]<img class=\"wp-image-74584\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-5.02.31-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-09-23 at 5.02.31 PM\" width=\"437\" height=\"254\" \/> Guidance Office and the College and Career Center will move to the 500 building, allowing space for a Meeting Room and Alumni Room respectively in the Tower Building, according to the board meeting agenda.\u00a0Illustration\u00a0courtesy of DLM Architecture.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAccording to Berkson, the library construction is dependent on the gym construction because of the limited substitute space. This poses a threat to the planned construction time as the recent delay in the gym construction has pushed back its proposed finishing date to Dec. 2016.\r\n\r\nThe board will vote to approve the conceptual design, budget and contract for the schematic design in the next meeting on Oct. 7 at the PAUSD office.","excerpt":"The Strong Schools Bond Program will present revised conceptual designs for the 500 building, including a new library and collaboration spaces.","date":"2014-09-23 18:44:31","author":"Takaaki Sagawa","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-20-at-9.51.58-PM.png","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"29186":"500 building","8458":"administration","21437":"bond","29193":"budget","8558":"campus","9678":"career","8570":"center","8604":"college","29189":"conceptual","8616":"construction","29188":"design","8748":"Guidance","29191":"hub","8848":"Library","25038":"McGee","29190":"mezzanine","8912":"new","29192":"office","9681":"PLAN","11895":"plans","9021":"quad","29187":"renovation","9069":"School Board","9177":"tower building"}},{"id":74598,"title":"Deadline for dropping a class Oct. 9","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/23\/deadline-for-dropping-a-class-oct-9\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2014-09-23 17:47:04","author":"Lizzie Chun","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":{"8589":"class","8636":"deadline","29215":"drop","8658":"dropping"}},{"id":74529,"title":"Liveblog: Paly girls&#8217; volleyball takes on rival in first game of season","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/23\/live-blog-paly-girls-volleyball-takes-on-rival-in-first-game-of-season\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_74618\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/photo4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-74618\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/photo4.jpg\" alt=\"Palo Alto High School girls' volleyball team cheers in their huddle right before their first league game against rival, Gunn High School.

Photo by Amy Leung.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nRecently, students have been taking a WASC survey in their English classes. But many students find themselves wondering: what is WASC?\r\n\r\nAccording to the Palo Alto High School WASC Coordinator and Spanish teacher Emily Garrison, WASC stands for the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.\r\n\r\n\u201cWASC is a non-profit organization,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cIt works very closely with the California Department of Education, but it doesn\u2019t have any other affiliations besides that really.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat exactly does WASC do then?\r\n\r\n\u201cIn order to make your transcript valid for college, we have to be WASC accredited,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cEverybody wants to have WASC accreditation because basically what that says is the coursework, what\u2019s happening on campus, is valid.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe surveys administered in English classes provide guidance for improving the school.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the end of the year, we\u2019re going to be done with one of our six-year cycles, and the reviews that students have done are going to be part of the process that we go through in deciding how well the school has done and where we can move on from this point,\u201d said junior Molly Kraus, a member of the student WASC group.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur job is to do two things \u2014\u00a0what\u2019s Paly doing really well?\u201d Garrison said. \u201cWe really are an amazing school. But with any school, or with any student or any person, even if that person is amazing, there\u2019s still always things that you can improve upon. So that\u2019s the second part of WASC.\u201d\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Paly WASC group is finishing up the last cycle and starting a new one, according to Garrison. Students, parents and staff discussed the big pictures of what\u2019s going on at Paly at the most recent focus group meetings.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe really analyze that [information] and we think about it,\" Garrison said.\u00a0\"Then what we\u2019re going to do is put it in a much larger context and say OK, we want to try to focus in on three to five major goals.\u00a0We don\u2019t know what those are yet \u2014\u00a0we\u2019re not quite\u00a0there yet, but we\u2019ll be there soon. In the next month or so, those goals should be developed.\"\r\n\r\nAfter creating these goals, Garrison says that the next step is a commitment to working towards those objectives for the next six years until the next WASC cycle. For the time being, the group is gathering as much data as possible.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll this stuff we\u2019re doing right now goes into a big report that\u2019s probably going to be about 300 pages long,\" Garrison said. \"It\u2019ll be finished probably by the end of December. And then that whole report of those two big pieces \u2014 what does Paly look like and then how can we improve \u2014\u00a0that can then get sent to WASC.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter reading the Paly WASC\u00a0report, WASC will send a team in early March to validate the information.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey [WASC] are here to help support us,\" Garrison said. \"And they\u2019re going to be on campus, they\u2019re going to be in classes, they\u2019re going to want to talk to students.\u201d\r\n\r\nGarrison says that this month will be important for WASC updates because it's the starting point for the new cycle of this upcoming year.\r\n\r\n\"In the next month, things are really going to start getting interesting with WASC,\" Garrison said. \"We just want to make things better for students.\"","excerpt":"WASC is beginning its new six-year cycle this upcoming school year.

Puckett would later score again in the quarter on a 22-yard rush. However, Mitty senior quarterback Brett Foley kept his team in control, leading the Monarchs to a 34-14 lead at the half.\u00a0According to Puckett, the Vikings started the game with a positive and ready-to-win attitude, but were rattled as Mitty's lead grew during the first half.\r\n\r\n\"I believe tonight our team came out with a mindset to win,\" Puckett said. \"But when we saw Mitty score, we let up too early and put our heads down too early and let them keep pounding the ball. We definitely have a lot of work to do especially after tonight.\"\r\n\r\nAfter both teams opened the game with punts on each of their first offensive possessions, the Monarchs scored the first of eight touchdowns when junior running back Derek Bauerle broke free from the defense for a 28-yard touchdown. Their next score occurred just one minute later, when Vikings junior quarterback Oliver Svirsky's bootleg pass was intercepted by senior defensive back Adam Acevedo, who returned the ball 33 yards for a pick-six. The Monarchs offense would tack on more points before the end of the first quarter, putting the Vikings down 20 points after just twelve minutes of play.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_74319\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"800\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/LRP_03531.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-74319\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/LRP_03531.jpg\" alt=\"Jayshawn Puckett runs for the end zone during the game against Mitty.

It just so happens we're not there yet. We will be though.\"\r\n\r\nThe second half of the game opened up with two overpowering Monarch touchdowns, eliminating any chance of a potential comeback by the Vikings, and also silencing what had been a loud and active home crowd during the first half. While the rout continued to worsen, Svirsky, who was seen throughout the second half motivating his teammates to never give up, says that the team improved from last week's 33-0 loss at San Benito in terms of overall effort.\r\n\r\n\"It's different from San Benito,\" Svirsky said. \"San Benito we beat ourselves and gave up.

But I never gave up and kept at it, and within a few months, I was able to go from a crippled kid in a wheelchair to a world champion mountain runner.\u201d\r\n\r\nMatison\u2019s initial goal was never anything near qualifying for the World Mountain Running Championships. As soon as he was back on his feet, he simply started to look ahead to the cross country season.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy hope for [this] cross country season is for our team to make it to state and give it all we got when we're there,\u201d Matison said.\r\n\r\nMatison\u2019s impressive runs during the off-season, which he recorded on the run recording app Strava, were spotted by a member of the senior United States Mountain Running team, David Roche. According to Matison, Roche advised him to send his running resume to the team\u2019s head coach.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo qualify for the national team, you had to fill out an application with a running resume, your most impressive running achievements and send it to the junior team coach,\u201d Matison said. \u201cYou also had to have a 5k time of 16:30 or faster. Only four boys aged 16-19 in the country are chosen.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_74171\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"341\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/10592921_10154621890755374_84425878604594770_n1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-74171\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/10592921_10154621890755374_84425878604594770_n1.jpg\" alt=\"(Paly senior Lucas Matison runs up the side of a mountain in Italy during the World Mountain Running Championships on Sept. 14.

He went over the course with them: an 8.4 kilometers course featuring a total ascent of 710 meters, one that goes through caves, up stairways and finishes on a terrace of quarry facing the sea.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_74164\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1065\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/1068x352xaltimetriaP20SFP20-P20JM.jpg.pagespeed.ic_.zeDDXPFob3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-74164\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/1068x352xaltimetriaP20SFP20-P20JM.jpg.pagespeed.ic_.zeDDXPFob3.jpg\" alt=\"Profile of the Junior Mountain Running World Championship at Cassette di Cassa, Italy\" width=\"1065\" height=\"352\" \/><\/a> Profile of the Junior Mountain Running World Championship at Cassette di Cassa, Italy.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nMatison says that everyone gave all they had to finish in 10th place in the overall team rankings.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am very pleased by my team's performance,\u201d Matison said. \u201cEveryone gave it all they had.
