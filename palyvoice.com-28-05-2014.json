Photo by tribecafilm.com.\" width=\"800\" height=\"422\" \/><\/a> \"Palo Alto\" centers around the experiences of two teens, April (Emma Roberts) and Teddy (Jack Kilmer). Photo by tribecafilm.com.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIt turns out the only thing that angers Palo Altans more than James Franco\u2019s novel \u201cPalo Alto: Stories\u201d is Gia Coppola\u2019s film adaptation of that book, \"Palo Alto.\"\r\n\r\nThe drama, based on a select few of the stories written by Franco in his novel, follows the confusing, angst-ridden life of high school students. April (Emma Roberts) is a quiet girl who plays on the school soccer team. While her parents may be negligent, her coach Mr B. (James Franco) gives her more than enough attention, appropriate or otherwise. Meanwhile, Teddy (Jack Kilmer) and his dangerously rebellious friend Fred (Nat Wolff) are constantly getting into trouble just for the sake of it.\r\n\r\nIf the plot sounds bland, that\u2019s because it is. Nothing happens in this film. Perhaps Coppola wanted to simply show section of the lives of these characters, but their problems and actions are so useless the story ends up being average. It\u2019s hard to relate to characters when they do things for no specific reason and barely, or never, learn from their mistakes.\r\n\r\nThe general explanation of these characters\u2019 actions is their ubiquitously bad\u00a0parents, but that hardly explains most of what happens in the film. If one of the characters had that problem, and the problem was really focused on, it would be excusable, but that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s a lazy writing technique, and inspires no love for the characters.\r\n\r\nActually, that would be a good way of describing most of the writing: lazy. Every character besides Teddy and April are archetypal and act without reason or intention. Seriously, how many times are we going to see a high school film with unexplainably malicious popular girls until it gets boring?\r\n\r\nTo continue the motif of laziness, the film is full of pseudo-deep shots and scenes. The meaning or point of them is implied, but is not actually there. An example: a minute-long shot of April looking out a window is not deep, it\u2019s boring. There\u2019s no content to shots like these; if a character is supposed to be thinking, there are better ways to show that then to let\u00a0the audience guess.\r\n\r\nThe one redeeming part of the writing was some of the humor. Most of it consists of stupid, immature jokes, or silly tidbits of dialogue, but its accuracy to the way that high school students act made it amusing. Someone blurting a lame, uninspired insult about their friend\u2019s sexuality isn't inherently funny \u2013 it\u2019s funny because it\u2019s just the kind of obnoxious thing a teenager would do. Once again the issue comes back to laziness, when jokes and gags are repeated.\r\n\r\nPerformance-wise, the film was acceptable. None of\u00a0the actors ended up being more than decent because, as good as their performances were, their roles were so boring and melodramatic it gave them few opportunities to actually show their ability.\r\n\r\nThe film actually had some great moments of camerawork and editing. A lot of the cinematography felt fitting and interesting, especially the shots of suburban night life. The pacing of shots complimented the content of the scenes well. The film seemed to have a high-contrast filter, which really helped the mood. Colors were vibrant and pleasing to look at, which contrasted interestingly with the darker content.\r\n\r\nSome residents of real-life Palo Alto have criticized the film for portraying the town in an unfairly negative light, but in reality nothing in the movie is specific or even connected to the actual city. None of Palo Alto\u2019s notable attributes, such as Facebook headquarters or the presence of Stanford, are more than slightly alluded to, and the settings in which the film takes place are clearly <i>not <\/i>Palo Alto (to a native Palo Altan, at least). The movie was actually filmed entirely in Southern California.\r\n\r\nSo, rather than specifically criticising the local\u00a0culture in the manner of \u201cSilicon Valley,\" \u201cPalo Alto\u201d is actually meant to serve as a portrait of teenage life anywhere in the country. Its name ends up being little more than a placeholder that could potentially be interchanged with any other town \u2013 Palo Alto just happened to be James Franco\u2019s childhood home and therefore the nominal location of his stories. The supposed denigration of the town turns out to be a non-issue; the <a href=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/james-francos-palo-alto\">\"shadowy side of Palo Alto\"<\/a>\u00a0is really just the negative aspects of teenage life everywhere.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the film offers a generally reasonable but oversimplified look at the adolescent experience. The issues and challenges faced by the movie\u2019s characters are certainly real, but the one-dimensional characters greatly reduce its believability \u2013 and there are certain moments of dialogue which simply don\u2019t feel real (not to mention the unrealistically high amount of cigarette smoking by the teens in the supposedly present-day setting of the movie). The film manages to touch on elements of what it is like to be a teenager, but its lack of significant plot or point ultimately prevents it from being more than a pessimistic, apathetic adaptation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>\u201cPalo Alto\u201d<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>1 hour, 40 minutes<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Rated: R for strong sexual content, drug and alcohol use, pervasive language, smoking, all involving teens<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Directed by Gia Coppola<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Starring: James Franco, Emma Roberts, Jack Kilmer<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Based on the novel <\/b><b><i>Palo Alto <\/i><\/b><b>by James Franco<\/b>","excerpt":"It turns out the only thing that angers Palo Altans more than James Franco\u2019s novel \u201cPalo Alto\u201d is Gia Coppola\u2019s film adaptation of that book by the same name.","date":"2014-05-27 11:17:34","author":"Drew Keller","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/emma_jack_party.jpg","categories":["Entertainment","Reviews","Spotlight"],"tags":{"19415":"Emma Roberts","8706":"film","19414":"Gia Coppola","8801":"james franco","8899":"movie","19416":"Nat Wolff","8939":"palo alto","9045":"review"}},{"id":72192,"title":"Students to perform in teen musical","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/27\/students-to-perform-in-teen-musical\/","content":"Fifteen\u00a0Palo Alto High School students will be taking part\u00a0in a teen musical from June 12-28 at Southside Theater in San Francisco, Calif.\r\n\r\nThe indie-rock musical, Body of Water, is unique in its\u00a0scripting as it is a\u00a0non-traditional take on musicals, according to senior Aaron Slipper.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #3e454c;\">\"Body of Water is 'Breakfast Club'\u00a0meets 'Lord of the Flies'\u00a0meets 'Schindler's List',\" Slipper said. \"It is an exciting and very original musical.

Photo by Amanda Carlsson.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe school year is finally coming to a close and among countless projects and\u00a0finals, The Paly Voice wanted to take a break and remember all that has happened this past semester at Palo Alto High School and within the Paly community. Despite\u00a0controversial news surrounding old Paly administration dominating the community, these past months have also been filled with fun and success. Before we all throw our books in the air and head into summer, we want to take a moment to reflect upon the last five months:\r\n\r\n<b>Clubs\u00a0<\/b>\r\n\r\nClubs continued to be active on campus this semester in lunchtime performances, competitions and events. A highlight for clubs this spring semester came when the Science Olympiad team placed first in regionals to advance to the Northern California state competition, where it came in <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/17\/science-olympiad-places-second-at-state-competition\/\">second place<\/a>. The Robotics team came in <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/10\/robotics-team-places-22nd-out-of-58-at-silicon-valley-regional\/\">22nd<\/a> out of 58 teams in the Silicon Valley Regional competition to conclude its season. The club\u2019s robot is built entirely by students, with little help from adult mentors. Additionally, The Best Buddies club was <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/21\/palys-best-buddies-chapter-awarded-outstanding-high-school-chapter-of-the-year\/\">honored<\/a> as an \u201cOutstanding High School Chapter of the Year\u201d for the second year in a row.\r\n\r\n<b>Administration\u00a0<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis semester saw not only changes in staff, but a change in administration attitudes. The administration selected Earl Hansen\u2019s replacement: <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/03\/19\/breaking-news-admin-selects-new-athletic-director\/%20\">Jason Fung<\/a>. Not only is he a Paly graduate (\u201892), but he has been actively involved in multiple sports programs at Paly since 2008. Next, the administration selected <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/03\/04\/meet-chase-palys-new-campus-supervisor\/%20 \">Chase Hartmann<\/a> to replace Mary Puorro as the new campus supervisor. You can catch Hartmann riding around campus on one of the golf carts. Finally, Principal Kim Diorio <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/03\/25\/principal-reaches-out-to-community-with-coffee-and-pizza\">reached out<\/a> to students in a whole new kind of way this semester: through pizza (and coffee for the parents). In an effort to reach out to the student and parent community, Diorio has installed a new series of lunch and morning meetings that will continue into next year.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sports\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\nSports this semester had many highs and lows, wins and losses and seasons ending and beginning. Winter sports seasons concluded on a bold note this semester, and spring sports began immediately after, with some spring seasons still\u00a0underway.\r\n\r\nThe boys' basketball season ended in March with a 43-51 <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/03\/02\/boys-basketball-falls-to-m-a-in-ccs-quarter-finals-43-51\/\">loss<\/a> to Menlo-Atherton High School in the Central Coast Section\u00a0quarterfinals. The team boasted a winning record, going\u00a015-11 overall and 8-4 in league.\r\n\r\nThe girls' basketball team made a strong run in the CCS playoffs, <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/03\/04\/slideshow-girls-basketball-beats-mountain-view-in-ccs-thriller\/\">beating<\/a> Mountain View High School in a huge comeback\u00a0to advance to the CCS semifinals, where it then\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/03\/05\/liveblog-girls-basketball-takes-on-north-salinas-in-ccs-semi-finals\/\">fell<\/a> to North Salinas High School. A highlight of the season came when the team <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/02\/03\/girls-basketball-triumphs-over-gunn-49-45\/\">beat<\/a> cross-town rival Gunn High School for\u00a0the last time\u00a0in the Big Gym before its planned demolition this summer. Gunn had beaten Paly twice the year before, so this close 49-45 win had even more meaning for the team.\r\n\r\nThe boys' soccer team ended its season with a 7-8-5 record, falling just short of qualifying for\u00a0the CCS playoffs.\r\n\r\nThe girls' soccer team had a strong winning record of 11-5-5. The team's season ended in a 0-2 loss to Los Gatos High School in the CCS semifinals.\r\n\r\nThe wrestling team placed sixth place at the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League finals, allowing it to keep its spot in the De Anza League for next season.\r\n\r\nAs for the spring sports, the baseball team (15-14, 9-4) failed to capture a league title this year, but<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/05\/baseball-season-update-vikings-confident-for-playoffs\/\"> looked to make a decisive run<\/a> in the SCVAL Playoffs, which began with a decisive 5-0 win over Wilcox High School. However, the\u00a0Vikings lost a three-game league championship series to\u00a0Saratoga High School after being down\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/13\/pitchers-fail-to-hold-early-lead-vikings-fall-to-saratoga\/\">one game to none<\/a>\u00a0to take second place in the SCVAL. The team then took\u00a0\u00a0on Leland High School in the first round of CCS Playoffs yesterday, where it fell, 4-8.\r\n\r\nAfter moving down to the El Camino Division of SCVAL and hiring an ex-San Francisco Giant to coach, the softball team greatly improved upon last year\u2019s overall record of 3-22 and is now 14-12 overall and 4-7 in league. The team honored its seniors on <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/14\/slideshow-softball-trounces-fremont-on-senior-night\/\">Senior Night<\/a>, where the Lady Vikings dominated Fremont High School. The boys\u2019 golf team had a successful season, capturing the SCVAL title for the second year in a row.\r\n\r\nThe boys\u2019 swimming team placed first in the SCVAL championships as well, and both the girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 teams had <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/01\/swimming-towards-ccs\/\">high expectations<\/a>\u00a0to make a strong showing in the Central Coast Section Playoffs. The boys' swimming team fell short of these goals\u00a0by barely losing in the CCS finals to the now 30-year reigning CCS champs Bellarmine High School last weekend.\r\n\r\nBoth the girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 track and field teams finished\u00a0in the middle of the pack in terms of league standings, but competitors of individual events were\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/01\/track-and-field-races-to-the-finish-line\/\">expected to do well<\/a>\u00a0throughout the\u00a0CCS playoffs. One such event was the 200 meters, for which senior Nick Sullivan and sophomore\u00a0Eli Givens placed second and third respectively in the CCS finals yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe girls\u2019 lacrosse team ended its season with a win by\u00a0\u00a0beating Saratoga High School\u00a0in the SCVAL championships. One\u00a0highlight of the season came with a <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/12\/slideshow-girls-lax-dominates-on-senior-night\/\">big win<\/a> over Los Gatos High School on Senior Night. Another was\u00a0beating St. Francis High School during the season and also\u00a0in the second round of SCVAL playoffs\u00a0for redemption after St. Francis ended last year's Paly season in a triple-overtime thriller.\r\n\r\nThe boys\u2019 lacrosse team recently defeated the previously undefeated Sacred Heart Preparatory, and advanced to the SCVAL semifinals where it<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/18\/boys-lacrosse-season-ends-in-11-10-loss-to-m-a-in-scval-semifinal\/\">\u00a0lost to<\/a>\u00a0Menlo-Atherton High School in a 10-11 nail-biter.\r\n\r\n<b>National Signing Day<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn early February, Paly hosted a <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/02\/06\/slideshow-senior-athletes-sign-national-letters-of-intent\/\">ceremony<\/a> for seniors signing their National Letters of Intent to play collegiate sports next year. The ceremony took place in the Big Gym and was led by Earl Hansen prior to his retirement. Eight seniors who will compete at both Division I and Division III levels attended the ceremony, although many other graduating students will also play varsity-level sports next year but did not attend. Approximately 30 Paly graduates\u00a0will be participating in varsity collegiate athletics next year.\r\n\r\n<b>New ASB officers <\/b>\r\n\r\nAfter an exciting and close candidate race in March, the school elected the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/03\/28\/brief-associated-student-body-election-results-annouced\/\">Associated Student Body Class of 2015<\/a>. Once the election was over, the new officers sat down with The Paly Voice to reveal some <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/22\/fun-facts-of-future-asb-officers\/\">fun facts<\/a> about themselves. In April, ASB chose <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/06\/liu-wins-asb-presidency-amid-higher-turnout\/\">next year\u2019s group<\/a> of appointed officers.\r\n\r\n<b>Phil Winston<\/b>\r\n\r\nAfter former Paly principal Phil Winston mysteriously resigned last summer, students were left wondering what had happened. Part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/11\/former-principal-subject-to-disciplinary-action-according-to-pa-weekly-investigation\/\">answer<\/a> came in April, when Palo Alto Weekly published an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/news\/2014\/04\/11\/ex-paly-principal-disciplined-for-harassment\">article<\/a> outlining the issues related\u00a0to Winston\u2019s resignation. The article spurred a whirl of controversy among the Paly community, leaving some students pleased and other disappointed. The event was a significant moment in Paly culture, and left a large impact among the student body.\r\n\r\n<b>Prom<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis year\u2019s Prom was different than any other ever held before: not only was it held at a new and uncommon\u00a0venue, but it was also the highest attended\u00a0Prom in years. Prom was held at the San Francisco Exploratorium this year, at the museum\u2019s new location on Pier 15. Although this venue choice <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/08\/are-prom-tickets-more-expensive\/\">made Prom tickets more expensive,<\/a>\u00a0it brought a unique experience to Paly Prom-goers. Presumably as a result of its location, this year\u2019s Prom also brought about <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/10\/asb-carries-out-last-minute-preparations-for-record-breaking-prom\">record-breaking tickets numbers<\/a>. With combined evidence from ticket numbers and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/21\/opinion-prahmm-2k14-in-review\">student surveys<\/a>, this year\u2019s Prom was one of the most successful in Paly history.\r\n\r\n<strong>Construction<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAfter an extended construction period, the new two-story classroom building and the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/01\/28\/slideshow-paly-media-arts-center\/\">Media Arts Center<\/a> finally were up and available for students to glimpse into after Spring Break. Although neither will officially open until the start of the 2014-2015 school year, students have been able to tour the buildings, and some Advanced Placement tests were taken in the new classroom building.\u00a0The iconic Big Gym, which will be torn down this summer, was celebrated\u00a0in a \u201cFarewell Big Gym\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/03\/25\/slideshow-farewell-big-gym-event-a-fitting-celebration\/\">event<\/a>\u00a0in mid-March, honoring the 85 years it held athletic events, dances and more.\r\n\r\n<b>Powderpuff<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis year\u2019s powderpuff competition saw many changes. The ASB class under Matt Hall and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/03\/19\/breaking-news-admin-selects-new-athletic-director\/\">new athletic director<\/a> Jason Fung came together this year after complaints from previous years about team selections. This year was the first year a raffle system was implemented to select the teams as opposed to leaving the selection up to each class. This year, new rules prohibited the quarterback from running and required all players to wear mouthguards. In the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/01\/slideshow-underclassmen-dominate-powderpuff\/\">first round<\/a>, the seniors took on the freshmen. The seniors, seemingly frazzled by the new rules and new team, fell to the freshmen, 0-7. The sophomores and juniors then faced off, and the sophomore class proved victorious, 21-0. In the finals, which occurred during a long lunch thanks to a special schedule, the sophomores crushed the freshmen to take home the title. The powderpuff final half-time featured a celebration in honor of retiring physical education teacher, football coach and athletic director Earl Hansen and Sports Literature teacher and football announcer Mike\u00a0McNulty.\r\n\r\n<b>NIOS\u00a0<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis April, Not In Our School\u2019s week came to a <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/19\/paly-to-host-annual-not-in-our-schools-week\/\">much larger forefront<\/a> than in past years with daily lunchtime activities and performances. Each day had a color and a theme, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/24\/slideshow-nios-day-three\/\">Ability Awareness<\/a>, to go along with the activities.\r\n\r\n<b>Paly alumni<\/b>\r\n\r\nPaly alumnus of the Class of 2011 Davante Adams was <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/10\/paly-alumnus-drafted-by-the-green-bay-packers\/\">drafted<\/a> by the Green Bay Packers in the second round of this year\u2019s NFL draft. Adams was a member of the Paly State Championship team his senior year in high school. James Franco, a member of the Class of 1996, stars in his own movie titled \u201cPalo Alto,\u201d which was just released.

After a series of racist remarks surfaced the internet, the owner of the Clippers' basketball team was thrown into a fire of angry backlash.

In the end, Sterling ended up being banned for life from the National Basketball Association, as NBA commissioner Adam Silver took a firm stance against racism and united the entire country against it as well. Sterling\u2019s consequences were met with pleasure from mass audiences who feel that such radical statements have no place in our nation\u2019s progress.","excerpt":"The school year is finally coming to a close, and among countless projects and finals The Paly Voice wanted to take a break and remember all that has happened this past semester at Palo Alto High School.","date":"2014-05-22 17:30:14","author":"Becca Raffel","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/rsz_photo-2-copy.jpg","categories":["Features"],"tags":{"8410":"Baseball","10098":"basketball","8644":"diorio","15675":"donald sterling","8704":"field day","14851":"fun","8738":"Golf","8836":"Lacrosse","11162":"media arts building","19409":"new classroom building","15846":"powderpuff","9016":"prom","9110":"Soccer","9241":"wrestling"}},{"id":72280,"title":"Vandalism incidents on newly-repainted Senior Deck cause stir","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/22\/vandalism-incidents-on-newly-repainted-senior-deck-cause-stir\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_72328\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"547\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/Screen-Shot-2014-05-21-at-8.27.00-PM.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-72328\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/Screen-Shot-2014-05-21-at-8.27.00-PM.png\" alt=\"According to an anonymous trio of juniors, some members of the junior class painted over the '2014' on the Senior Deck Monday night in response to tension on Twitter between members of the junior and senior classes.

According to senior Ethan Look, social media posts by the juniors of themselves enjoying the Senior Deck prompted him to tweet the following message:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/Screen-Shot-2014-05-21-at-4.33.48-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-72281\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/Screen-Shot-2014-05-21-at-4.33.48-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"615\" height=\"313\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nThe witness said that the consequent Twitter conversation, of which various Paly upperclassmen and alumni were contributors, sparked a group of juniors to form a plan to retaliate by painting over part of the deck.\r\n\r\n\u201cA bunch of people \u00a0were fed up with how the seniors were being really rude to us [on Twitter],\u201d the anonymous junior said.\r\n\r\nWhile Look said he did not intend for his tweet to be taken literally, he did agree that the Twitter conversations contributed to the motives for the vandalism.\r\n\r\n\u201cI certainly do think the arguments on Twitter fueled the fire,\u201d Look said. \u201cWith my first tweet, I had no intentions of making anybody mad. I strongly believe that the next senior class deserves to inherit the deck, but I wouldn\u2019t be a senior if I didn\u2019t defend my turf a little.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_72286\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"400\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/photo1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-72286\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/photo1.jpg\" alt=\"Students gather on the Senior Deck during seventh period Wednesday afternoon.

The scrubbing process took around one-and-a-half hours.\r\n\r\nThe deck, now restored to its fresh paint job, features a camouflage-print background and '2014' written in large white numbers across its surface.\r\n\r\n\u201cSince the first day of school this year, my friends and other people have been talking about painting the deck and making it better,\u201d Tawzer said. \u201cMy hope of painting the deck was that the Class of 2014 would leave behind a new tradition or legacy to the other classes to come. I meant for this to be a fun, cool way for the senior classes to bond and add their own style and class spirit to the deck when their time came.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the junior witness, who said she watched others paint the '5', the students who allegedly painted over the deck were not trying to be disrespectful.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t trying to be disrespectful at all,\u201d the source said. \u201cIf we knew that it would hurt their feelings or that it had anything with them trying to give a gift to the school [we wouldn\u2019t have done it].\u201d\r\n\r\nA second junior who took part in the vandalism added that many juniors were not happy with the design of the deck because it clearly is associated with the Class of 2014.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_72282\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"wp-image-72282\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/Screen-Shot-2014-05-21-at-4.34.16-PM.png\" alt=\"Senior Ethan Look tweeted an edited picture of the deck vandalism, adding 'PALY' over the '2014' to encourage school unity, he said.

After first coming to Palo Alto in 2011, Kwon spent three years of school at Paly. While Kwon's time in Palo Alto was short-lived, he said that he really enjoyed his time living the \"California\" lifestyle and felt that Palo Alto was the best place in which he has ever lived.\r\n\r\nMost of all, Kwon enjoyed Palo Alto's \"great weather, great food and great people.\" During his time here, Kwon was an active, high-achieving student. Kwon played badminton and tennis, took \"inspirational\" adventures through state parks and made some of \"the best relationships [he] might ever make.\" Although Kwon was sad about losing his new friends in the move back to South Korea, he has been able to stay in touch through social media and believes that the friendships he made will last for a lifetime.\r\n\r\n<em>The Paly Voice<\/em> decided to catch up with Kwon via Facebook to find out more about the differences between life in Palo Alto and South Korea.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice: Why did you have to move between the U.S. and South Korea?\r\n\r\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Henry Do Hyun Kwon: I went to the U.S. in February of 2011 due to my dad's job and left in January of 2014 for the same reason.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nTPV: Where do you live in South Korea?\r\n\r\nHDHK: Now I live in Gangnam, which is a district of Seoul, the capital city of South Korea.\r\n\r\nTPV:\u00a0Can you describe your typical day in South Korea?\r\n\r\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">HDHK: I wake up at 6:30 in the morning, wash up, eat breakfast and bike to school. School starts at 7:50 and ends at 4:10 everyday except Fridays, when school ends at 3:10. Most 11th and 12th graders in Korea are required to stay after school and study until night, but my school lets students go early because most students go to \"hagwons,\" after school private classes and tutoring sessions. As for me, I don't go to \"hagwons\" yet, but when I get home, I take online classes, which is another studying trend here in Korea. For free time, I usually play computer games. I eat dinner around 7:30 to 8 and go to sleep 12 [midnight]\u00a0to 1 a.m.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_72465\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"478\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/10384969_625200674228062_98041656_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-72465\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/10384969_625200674228062_98041656_n.jpg\" alt=\"Henry Do Hyun Kwan, former Paly student, stands with his new class in South Korea. \" width=\"478\" height=\"269\" \/><\/a> Henry Do Hyun Kwan, former Paly student, stands with his new class in South Korea. Photo by Jung-Soo Lee.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTPV:\u00a0What are the academic differences between the U.S. and South Korea?\r\n\r\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">HDHK: School operates quite differently in Korea. First of all, the teachers are the ones moving around classrooms, not the students. Schedules are not adjustable. Students must decide on a curriculum track between the natural sciences and liberal arts. Also, Korean schools are greatly influenced by parents. Currently, many schools in Korea are either single-sex schools. My school has both sexes, but the classes are separated by gender. Korean schools have four big tests in a school year \u2014 a midterm and a final for each semester. Teachers in Korea like to make tests extremely hard, especially math teachers. The 11th grade average for the math midterm this year in my school is expected to be around 30%. Usually there's not too much school homework in my school, which is a decision regarding the homework from \"hagwons.\" Korean high school students lack time from the intense studying. A survey revealed that the average sleeping hours for Korean highschoolers is about five hours and 30 minutes. One positive thing here is that lunch is 70 minutes long.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nTPV:\u00a0How do students choose an academic path, and how does it affect their curriculum and future jobs?\r\n\r\nHDHK: Students decide their academic paths based on their future plans, their previous grades, interests, etcetera. And those who can't decide will take tests in order to find out which path they choose. Students usually make up their minds when they enter high school [entering 10th grade]. The curriculum gets divided in 11th grade. You aren't necessarily \"locked in\" to a specific career, but you pretty much get restrained in your future plans. For example when you choose the liberal arts curriculum, you are not very likely to choose a mathematic or scientific based major in college. Most importantly, students take different high school entrance exams based on what curriculum you were in, and the Korean high school entrance exam is the most common path students take to go to college.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_72466\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"419\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/10388456_625200594228070_308612990_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-72466\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/10388456_625200594228070_308612990_n.jpg\" alt=\"Henry Do Hyun Kwon poses for a pictures with two of his classmates in South Korea. \" width=\"419\" height=\"314\" \/><\/a> Henry Do Hyun Kwon poses for a pictures with two of his classmates in South Korea. Photo by Jung-Soo Lee.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTPV:\u00a0What are some social differences between the U.S. and South Korea?\r\n\r\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">HDHK: In America, everyone needs a car. We need to drive in order to dine out or go grocery shopping. But in Korea, my family doesn't even have a car yet. Daily life is possible without a car. Instead, public transportation is highly developed. Housing in Korea is mostly apartments. Wherever you go in Korea, you are bound to find apartments \u2014 from the little ones, five stories tall, to 40-story apartments. Some call Korea \"a forest of apartments.\" In Korea, delivery food is very developed. Most fast food restaurants deliver, including McDonald's and Dominoes. The most popular delivery food here is probably chicken.<\/span>\r\n\r\nTPV:\u00a0What do you and your friends do for fun?\r\n\r\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">HDHK: Social life is not that different here in Korea. When we hang out, we can go to the theater or play games. The most popular thing is to go to \"PC cafes\" to play computer games.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nTPV:\u00a0What kind of music and movies are popular?\r\n\r\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">HDHK: Koreans love watching movies of different genres. Some popular foreign movies in Korea are \"Amazing Spiderman 2,\" \"Rio 2,\" \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier,\" \"Divergent\" and \"Mr. Peabody and Sherman\" \u2014 all in the top 10 movies currently. The music trend in Korea currently is dominated by \"Akdong Musician,\" a sibling duo who won the Korean audition show \"Kpop Star\" season two.
