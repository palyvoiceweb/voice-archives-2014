The Vikings were never able to make a comeback.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe started out well, but we didn't make the adjustments we had to in the end,\u201d coach Brandon Johnson said. \u201cThe team could have been a little more patient. They [Salinas] ran a pretty weird defense, and we gave into what they wanted.\u201d\r\n\r\nEven though the team\u2019s season ended on a bitter note, it was extremely successful overall, according to senior captain Lucas Novak. The Vikings tied first place with Gunn High School for the league championship title.\r\n\r\nThe team season could have been more successful if they had played at a consistent level throughout the season, according to junior driver Ryan Reed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe played down [to] the level of our opponents, which has unfortunately been a recurring theme this season,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWhen we are on our game, we can challenge top North California Section\u00a0and Central Coast Section teams like Las Lomas and St. Francis but then struggle against teams like Salinas that we should be able to put away in one quarter.\u201d\r\n\r\nStill, according to Reed, the team has high hopes for the next season if the Vikings are able to fix this flaw.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019re losing five excellent seniors this year, next year\u2019s juniors are going to fill their spaces more than capably,\u201d Reed said. \u201c[Underclassmen] Jared Stanley and Nick Russell can become vital players with some more varsity experience.\u201d","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 water polo (12-13, 9-3) season ended last Thursday with a 10-9 loss to Salinas High School (18-4, 8-2).","date":"2014-11-18 14:13:37","author":"Samuel Desr\u00e9","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/10683495_936995846317213_634147306_o11.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"9845":"boys water polo","32751":"fall sports 2014","8953":"paly","32468":"ryan reed","32750":"season recap","9846":"water polo"}},{"id":78849,"title":"I spy acai: Bare Bowls opens in Palo Alto","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/11\/18\/i-spy-acai-bare-bowls-opens-in-palo-alto\/","content":"Bare Bowls, the first acai bowl shop to open in Palo Alto, is a healthy addition to the downtown restaurant collection, opening at 530 Emerson St. earlier this month.\r\n\r\nBare Bowls specializes in acai bowls -- a kind of healthy smoothie made\u00a0with the Brazilian fruit acai -- and\u00a0other\u00a0health foods. The menu offers acai, pitaya (dragon fruit) and kale bowls, oatmeal and smoothies. Menu items do not include\u00a0added sweeteners or additives, according to the Bare Bowls\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.localfoodlab.com\/members\/bare-bowls-e5c6ba\">website<\/a>.

Bare Bowls has a\u00a0trendy and modern feel. The menu features a variety of uncommon foods including goji berries, cashew milk and hemp seeds. Photo by Alex Merkle-Raymond[\/caption]\r\n\r\nBare Bowls is allergen-conscious and community aware, according to its website. Bare Bowls requests that all customers tell them their food preferences before ordering in order to make sure the food is as satisfactory as possible. All the granola is gluten-free. The back wall of the restaurant has a message board where community members\u00a0can\u00a0advertise for activities around the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nSome\u00a0Palo Alto High School students find acai bowls a delicious snack and the experience enjoyable. Additionally, students appreciate what Bare Bowls has to offer over other acai bowls they have tried.\r\n\r\n\"Normally, acai bowls are too sweet, but Bare's isn't, so you can actually taste the small nuances they put in the toppings like agave nectar,\" senior Alexandra Hsieh said. \"I didn't stay for long, but the ambience was really nice.\"\r\n\r\nAs with many other\u00a0specialty restaurant for healthy foods, Bare Bowls is expensive. The small bowl is $8 and the regular bowl is $12, which may be out of many students\u2019 budgets, according to junior Molly Kraus.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt [Bare Bowls] tastes like overpriced Jamba Juice in a bowl,\u201d Kraus said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_78852\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"350\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/unnamed-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-78852\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/unnamed-1.jpg\" alt=\"Senior Oskar Soderberg and junior Molly Kraus play checkers at Bare Bowls.

But anyway, I'm excited to try their acai bowls soon.\"\r\n\r\nThere is limited seating at Bare Bowls, and there is rarely a line. However, as\u00a0more people\u00a0hear about Bare Bowls, expect a longer line \"because of the health food fanatics in this area are excited for its opening,\" according to Langston.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Bare Bowls celebrated its grand opening Saturday after starting business last Monday.

Even if students are not called back, there is a high likelihood that they can still be cast in the show.
