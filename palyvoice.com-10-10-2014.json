Not only is she the first (and only) American to have competed at the Olympic Games prior to the Youth Olympic Games, but Zhang is also the first to win a table tennis medal at the Olympic level for the U.S. She secured a bronze medal in women\u2019s singles table tennis last month at the Youth Olympics in Nanjing, China. After a victorious trip overseas, Zhang returned to the Bay Area to pursue her college education at University of California, Berkeley.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice caught up with Zhang to learn more about her experiences as a professional athlete.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Paly Voice:<\/strong> When\u00a0and why did you start playing table tennis?\r\n\r\n<strong>Lily Zhang:<\/strong> I started playing at the age of seven when my friend took me to the Palo Alto Table Tennis Club.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> What has been your favorite part about playing?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> There's so much that drew me to table tennis. I love the rapidity of the game, the vast amount of different strategies and styles, the mental aspect of the sport and I especially love traveling for tournaments and learning about the various cultures of the world.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> What are your hopes or expectations of the table tennis program at UC Berkeley?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> I know that UC Berkeley has one of the best table tennis teams in the nation and I already know many of the players on the team, so I'm extremely excited to join the team. I also hope to help the team win gold at the College Nationals next semester.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> How do you think the demands of a college student will affect your training?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> It's definitely much harder to practice here because of the demands of college, but I'm going to try to push myself to practice as much as I can on the weekends, as well as go home to my club on some weekends to practice.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> How has your experience at the Youth Olympic Games helped you as a professional athlete?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> Participating in the Youth Olympic Games has given me so much experience I can take with me to future tournaments or events. I think my mental game improved significantly after the Games, as I was able to calm myself down and breathe deeply whenever I got too nervous there.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> What\u2019s the most helpful advice your coach or anyone has ever given you?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> l think the most helpful advice I received was from my parents. Unlike many other parents in this sport, my parents never, ever pushed me to play table tennis and always gave me the choice to pursue what I wanted. In doing so, they helped me realize that I play because I truly love the sport, not because I was pushed or forced to.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> Do you have any advice for current Paly athletes?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> I guess my advice to current Paly athletes would be something along the same lines: Pursue something you're really passionate about\u00a0because you will work hard to achieve your goals, but at the same time, really enjoy doing it.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> What are the next steps in your table tennis career?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> I'm still trying to work it out with my professors, but I'm hoping to attend the 2014 World Junior Championships in Shanghai, China. It'll be my seventh time playing World Juniors, and my goal is to win the first ever medal for the U.S. there.","excerpt":"Making Olympic history for the United States is not something a typical 18-year-old can check off his or her bucket list.

Photo by Ana Caklovic.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTasting Week, a food event led by professional chefs, offers students in the Palo Alto Unified School District a chance to participate in various food-related workshops.\r\n\r\nAlthough the event is generally scheduled for Oct. 6-10, in reality, the celebration will extend into the next month, including a workshop held\u00a0on Oct. 23 at Gunn High School, according to the <a href=\"tastingweek.com\">Tasting Week website<\/a>. Palo Alto High School students are welcome and are encouraged to participate at the event.\r\n\r\nChefs from popular Bay Area restaurants are running workshops so that students can learn more about food in a qualitative way, according to Tasting Week event organizers. Some of the PAUSD schools participating will be Escondido Elementary School and Barron Park Elementary School, according to the Tasting Week Calendar on the website.\r\n\r\nOn a press release on Monday, PAUSD Communications Coordinator Tabitha Kappeler-Hurley wrote that some of the chefs leading the workshops include c<span style=\"color: #222222;\">hef Charlie Ayers from Calafia in Palo Alto, chef Marco Fossati from Four Seasons in Palo Alto and chef Nathan Beriau from Ritz Carlton in San Francisco.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe top chefs are visiting local schools to blossom students\u2019 love for food, share new tastes and aromas, as well as teach students alternatives to unhealthy food options, according to Kappeler-Hurley.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe idea to have Bay Area schools launch this celebration of food came from a group of Bay Area parents who believe that educating children about taste is the best way to get them to love food and, at the same time, to fight obesity,\u201d\u00a0Kappeler-Hurley wrote.\r\n\r\nAfter its launch in Palo Alto four years ago, Tasting Week has\u00a0now expanded to schools across the bay in cities such as San Francisco and Berkeley. The founder of the organization of the Bay Area Tasting Week organization is Rebecca Scholl-Barbier, a Palo Alto parent with four children in the PAUSD.\r\n\r\nSome students see the benefits of the event and are eager to sample and learn about the different tastes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d want to go to a workshop,\u201d Walter Hays Elementary fifth grader Hana Krieger said. \u201cI think it [Tasting Week] is good because it gives students a chance to try things for free.\u201d\r\n\r\nOthers understand the goal of Tasting Week, and see how it can educate people.\r\n\r\n\u201cA lot of people who don\u2019t know how to cook would want to go to the event,\" junior Isabelle Vincent said. \"People who don\u2019t really know what goes in their food can develop healthier eating habits [at the workshops]. It\u2019s always good to know how to cook at least one thing. I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to go [to a workshop] but if I knew it was happening and I was free I\u2019d go.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor those who are interested in participating in this event, the Tasting Week schedule for schools in the PAUSD can be found on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tastingweek.com\/calendar\/tasting-week-school-schedule-2014\/\">official website<\/a>.","excerpt":"Tasting Week, a food event led by professional chefs, offers students in the Palo Alto Unified School District a chance to participate in various food-related workshops.","date":"2014-10-09 15:09:11","author":"Ana Caklovic","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/photo-1.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8512":"Bay Area","29863":"chef","29864":"elementary school","8713":"Food","8751":"gunn","29867":"health","29866":"obesity","29862":"tasting week","29865":"walter hays"}},{"id":75082,"title":"APPetite blog: 2F1B","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/09\/appetite-blog-2f1b\/","content":"<em>Welcome to APPetite, a student-run blog all about apps.

But the growing dependency on this product and the technology behind it is transforming the culture of Palo Alto High\u00a0School. Technology represents the language of the next generation, the top end of the education spectrum and a community that\u2019s pushing the boundaries of innovation. But what is\u00a0Paly's latest obsession, both in the classroom and on the Quad?\u00a0The smartphone.\r\n\r\nSophomore Samarth Venkatasubramaniam agrees: \u201cBoth students and teachers [are] becoming really dependent on their smartphones,\" Venkatrasubramaniam said. \"Many teachers \u2026 ask you to pull out your phone and \u2018take this quiz\u2019 or \u2018use this app\u2019. And students \u2026 communicate using their phone whether it\u2019s chatting or texting and calling or Snapchatting \u2026 they\u2019re always on their phones for communication or studies.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe presence of iPhones and other smartphones in the classroom is viewed as an influence that can both help and distract. Students have a tendency to get distracted when they use their phones, but junior Ella Higashi thinks there are benefits that outweigh the risk of distraction.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy history class used them [smartphones] the other day, and I think it was helpful,\" Higashi said. \"Sometimes ... in science you can use your phone to upload things to the screen, which is really good for visual learning.\"\r\n\r\nSenior Claire Priestley also feels distraction\u00a0should not be a major concern when using smartphones\u00a0educationally.\r\n\r\n\u201cTeachers are really concerned with you not being on task with your phone but I think the majority of the people will stay on task because most people here are really good people,\u201d Priestley said.\r\n\r\nThe increasing use of smartphones in classroom activities may be due to an overall increase in smartphone ownership, specifically, iPhone ownership.\u00a0In a study entitled \u201cSmartphone Ownership in 2013,\u201d the Pew Research Center found that \u201cthose from the upper end of the income and education spectrum are much more likely than those with lower income and educational levels to say they own an iPhone.\" The study found that 25 percent of cellphone users in the U.S. own an iPhone.\r\n\r\nThe iPhones is\u00a0known\u00a0for its\u00a0beautiful design and intuitive interface. However, students like Higashi argue that the Apple product is overrated and that phones should be valued for their functionality instead of their beauty.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think other smartphones can do the same stuff as iPhones,\" Higashi said. \"I think it\u2019s more of the name \u2018iPhone.'\"\r\n\r\nAccording to senior Maeve Lavelle, the popularity of iPhones and the power of the brand name seems to only have increased with time.\r\n\r\n\u201cFreshman year it was kind of like, \u2018Oh, you have an iPhone, cool. I don\u2019t,\u2019 but it was still acceptable. By senior year everyone has an iPhone except for maybe the odd few, and if you don\u2019t have one by now, it\u2019s kind of like \u2018Oh, what\u2019s up with you?\u2019\u201d Lavelle said, who is an owner of an iPhone 5S.\r\n\r\nOne aspect that contributes to iPhone ownership may just be a matter of familiarity with the iPhone and an unwillingness to step out of the comfort zone of Apple products. \u201cI\u2019ve only had an iPhone... so I don\u2019t really know how to use phones that aren\u2019t iPhones,\u201d Priestley said. \u201cI think I\u2019d always stick with the iPhone because it\u2019s just what I know.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe iPhone can be either be perceived as a positive result of technology or an unnecessary display of money. iPhone culture is the feeling that an iPhones is the only acceptable type of phone, and that not having an iPhone is a huge loss and disadvantage.\r\n\r\n\u201c[iPhone culture] is a result of us being in the upper-middle class to upper class, and it\u2019s kind of a gross display of our wealth,\u201d junior Sean Jawetz said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it has a positive or negative effect on the culture of our student body.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dependency on smartphones shows that the technology culture is unnaturally strong and the iPhone culture even stronger. Paly students recognize that Paly\u2019s iPhone culture is the exception, not the rule.\r\n\r\nAs Venkatasubramaniam puts it, \u201cPhones are practical, obviously.That\u2019s why people use them.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_75349\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_97991.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-75349\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_97991.jpg\" alt=\"Sophomore Ciara Bleahen and sophomore Alicia Mies use their iPhones to listen to music and study in the library.

Photo by Chloe Fishman.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">This week The Paly Voice sat down with junior Zoe Limbrick to discuss her hilarious twitter, her love of bagels and her grandma's fridge.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice: You have an extremely funny Twitter. How did it all start?\r\n\r\nZoe Limbrick: So the story of how I made my Twitter was freshman year they were interviewing me for The Campanile's 1 in 2000 thing. What a great way to start off life. So I was just going through my interview, talking about myself, and they said \"You should make a Twitter\" and I was like \"Okay.\" I started off tweeting some weird puns about sloths and Aeropostale and stuff. I think I deleted them, I was so embarrassed. And then I sort of just evolved with my life and here I am as @CaptainGenovia.\r\n\r\nTPV: What is your favorite tweet?\r\n\r\nZL: I do not have a favorite tweet, because would JK Rowling have a favorite book? People would expected her to have \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" be her favorite book, but no. And my favorite tweet also is not my most popular tweet. I think it's some random tweet that nobody favorited from sophomore year. When the government was shut down, with a lot of abbreviations and stuff, \"you can shut down the government but you can't shut down my style.\" It got like two favorites. I was like \"Oh yeah! That is comedy gold.\"\r\n\r\nPV: Your most popular tweet is one referring to sophomore boys. Please explain the tweet and its inspiration.\r\n\r\nZL: The popular sophomore boys last year just never sat down during lunch, so I was like \"Please, rest your weary bones and take a rest.\" So I snapped a little pic and tweeted about it. It was \"Breaking news: popular sophomore boys are incapable of sitting.\"\r\n\r\nPV: If you could go anywhere in the world right now for a month, where would you go?\r\n\r\nZL: I'd go to New Zealand and roam with the sheep in the wilderness and have a good time. New Zealand is cool. My family is from New Zealand and I like it, and I know it as a place with lots of sheep. So I thought that would be a wild thing to bring up right now. Felt like an appropriate thing to say.\r\n\r\nPV: What is your favorite snack food?\r\n\r\nZL: Bagels are the backbone of this nation. If I had to live off of one item, it would be a bagel. There's a classic cream cheese, but also you can make a whole bagel sandwich. They are so diverse.\u00a0I saw a Tumblr post that said you could just cut a hole in a piece of bread and call it a bagel, but that is the most insulting thing you could ever say.\r\n\r\nPV: Tell us about your involvement in Paly Radio Club.\r\n\r\nZL: Well, once-upon-a-time, in beginning journalism, Paul Kandell asked if anyone wanted to do radio. So I raised my hand but I never actually went to any of the meetings. It turns out that nobody went to any of the meetings. Then Maya Kandell said \"Hello! My father has an opportunity for radio\" and I said \"well I still want to do that.\" And my life just sort of descended into recording myself saying things and then making everyone listen to it, which is the dream.\r\n\r\nPV: What do you talk about on the air?\r\n\r\nZL: Well last week, I interviewed Molly Kraus about a poem she wrote about Ferguson (Missouri), and I posted that on SoundCloud. And we just have a good time.\r\n\r\nPV: What would people be surprised to find out that you do in free time?\r\n\r\nZL: Unrelated to bagels or radio, I sort of just sit in my house and go on Twitter and Tumblr. I watch a lot of comedy TV. I was raised on \"Seinfeld\" and \"Spongebob Squarepants.\" That cultivated me as a human being.\r\n\r\nPV: Have you read Tina Fey's book?\r\n\r\nZL: Yes! I am obsessed with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler as a duo, and for my friend's birthday I found these weird necklaces from Etsy where someone did a shrinky dink of their faces. It's very low quality on these chains you'd probably buy from a random art store, and I was like \"Ah yes. I will spend $20 on shipping and handling on this. Definitely worth my money.\"\r\n\r\nPV: What did you do last night?\r\n\r\nZL: I went to the Lorde concert. It was at the Greek theatre in Berkeley. And she's such a chill person. She's like \"I feel connected to the trees and nature right now. I like performing outdoors.\" And I'm like \"You go, Lorde. You connect to your trees. Rock on.\" She has a very strange hair flip dance move. It's very weird how she and Taylor Swift are best friends.\r\n\r\nPV: What is the weirdest thing in your refrigerator right now?\r\n\r\nZL: My family and I are semi-hoarders. We never throw out food, so we probably have yogurt from two months ago. Oh wait, I can tell you about my grandma's fridge. She is also an insane hoarder but she keeps a stack of $20 bills in the back of her fridge for safe keeping. I have not seen it, but it's a rumor within my family that she has this stack.\r\n\r\nPV: Now everyone is going to try to rob her!\r\n\r\nZL: No her fridge is so strange, nobody will try and get into that ... She's going to see this. She's on Facebook, and we're friends. She's going to share it and be like 'God dammit, Zoe. I just used the Lord's name in vain for you.'\r\n\r\nPV: What has been your favorite experience at Paly so far?\r\n\r\nZL: That sounds like some spiritual thing. The first thing that comes to my head is the Weird Wednesday. As a freshman, I was like I'm gunna go all out. I came in paisley pajama pants tucked into these weird rain boots and a big rain coat with leg warmers on my arms and ski goggles. Yeah, rock on Paly! And I took the shuttle to school, which was first of all, a big mistake. I sat on the shuttle among all of the normally dressed high schoolers. So then I just traversed across the school looking like I was ready to go skiing and take a nap. I was like \"Oh dear, I'm a small freshman.\" I went all out, like \"I'm gonna rule this school. Everyone's gonna love me.\" I was trying to act like \"Oh yeah I'm in on the joke that I look like a fool right now.\"\r\n\r\nPV: What is the last thing you want to say to the Paly community?\r\n\r\nZL: Hello NSA Employees, I know you read this, you cheeky minxes, please remember to floss as it is critical to your dental health and your gums won't bleed at the dentist.\r\n\r\n<em style=\"color: #000000;\">If you know a student (or student group) who you think should be interviewed, please leave a comment below.<\/em>","excerpt":"This week The Paly Voice sat down with junior Zoe Limbrick to discuss her hilarious twitter, her love of bagels and her grandma's fridge.","date":"2014-10-07 14:47:57","author":"Lydia Barry","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_31802.jpg","categories":["Spotlight","Voice of the Week"],"tags":{"29809":"New Zealand","29808":"twitter","10258":"voice of the week","29690":"zoe limbrick"}},{"id":74473,"title":"Slideshow: Fiery Arts fall glass sale","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/07\/slideshow-fiery-arts-fall-glass-sale\/","content":"Thanks to proceeds from the annual fall glassblowing sale, half of the Palo Alto High School Fiery Art Program's operating budget\u00a0is secured\u00a0this year. \u00a0The sale, hosted by Paly's Fiery Arts program, took place\u00a0Sept. 19 and 20 on the corner of Embarcadero Road and El Camino Real.
