It has exciting fighting scenes, fun characters and a cute love story. Photo by Columbia Pictures.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nBad guys, fighting scenes, a cute superhero and young love are just some of the things that makes\u00a0\"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" great for a movie night with friends. It is a fun movie that\u00a0is definitely worth seeing as it is fun to watch and the ending will take\u00a0you by surprise with its unexpected twist.\r\n\r\nAs a fan of the Spider Man series, starring Tobey Maguire, I had some concerns when I heard about a new adaptation of the movies in 2012. Tobey Maguire was a great choice for that role, so imagining someone else play Spider Man was sad. However, once I saw \"The Amazing Spider-Man,\" I instantly loved the new Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as well as Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone). Garfield was a perfect fit for the role with his initial shyness and later\u00a0more extroverted personality that emerged as\u00a0he put on the spider suit. Since I was so happy with the first movie, when I heard about \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2,\" I knew I had\u00a0to see it.\r\n\r\nIn theaters now, \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" portrays Parker's struggle with pursuing his love interest, Stacey, figuring out the back story of his parent's leaving him as a child and, of course, stopping the criminals of New York. Parker and Stacey fell in love in the first movie, but in the new\u00a0movie, his protectiveness of her leads to a tense relationship.\u00a0Since Parker is Spider Man, Stacey\u00a0would be a target for his enemies, and he does not want to be responsible for anything that could happen to her.\r\n\r\nIn the new movie, Spider Man is soaring through New York City, trying to catch yet another criminal when he saves the life of Max Dillon\u00a0(Jamie Foxx) by pulling him out of the way of a moving vehicle. Dillon is very excited that someone notices him, later becoming obsessed with Spider Man. When Dillon is trying to fix a leak for his company, Oscorp, he falls into a tub of electric eels, transforming him into Electro, a man who gains the ability to control electricity. As Electro tries to become accustomed to his new powers, he develops a dislike for Spider Man, who he thinks is trying to hurt him.\r\n\r\nAnother enemy of Spider Man arises from Harry Osborn\u00a0(Dane DeHaan). Osborn and Parker were friends when they were younger, but Osborn was sent to boarding school before Parker became Spider Man. When Osborn comes back to take over his father's multibillion-dollar company, Oscorp after his death, they rekindle their friendship. Upon realizing\u00a0that he has a deadly genetic disease, Osborn decides he\u00a0must figure out how\u00a0to survive. When Spider Man refuses to help Osborn live, Osborn becomes angry with him\u00a0and decides to take revenge. Through dangerously inserting spider venom into his blood, Osborn is able to live as he becomes the Green Goblin and tries to\u00a0destroy Spider Man.\r\n\r\nWhile the plot is entertaining, Osborn's part seems unimportant toward the story. It is interesting that the writers brought\u00a0in a friend from Parker's past,\u00a0but once Osborn becomes evil, his role just seems like an unnecessary\u00a0twist to the plot. The Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) from the original Maguire series, had a better back story that set him up for the plot. Osborn's transformation into an evil villain seems thrown together with not much thought behind it.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography, by Daniel Mindel, is one of the most enjoyable parts of the movie. In the beginning of the film, Spider Man is going around over the city, flying back and forth. The way it was filmed\u00a0makes it feel like the audience is flying through the city with him. Not only is\u00a0it fun to watch, but it also lets the audience be a part of the action.\r\n\r\nDespite the problem I had with Osborn's character, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would suggest that people see \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\".\u00a0The great battle scenes and Spider Man flying around keep audiences stuck to their seats, while the adorable love story between Stacey and Parker pull at the audience's hearts, especially at\u00a0the end.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b>The Amazing Spider-Man 2\r\n<\/b><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2 hours 22 minutes<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rated PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action\/violence<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Directed by\u00a0Marc Webb<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>With\u00a0Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx<\/strong><\/p>","excerpt":"Bad guys, fighting scenes, a cute superhero and young love are just some of the things that makes \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" great for a movie night with friends.

The Falcons defeated Gunn High School (15-3) by a score of 9-8 in the semifinals on Wednesday to advance to the finals.\r\n\r\nJunior midfielder Paige Bara says she is proud of how the team's season has turned out.\r\n\r\n\"We are so incredibly excited to be going to the championships,\" Bara said. \"In the past we have struggled with beating Saint Francis in the playoffs so it feels pretty great to have finally accomplished that. I think we've really proven ourselves as a program and a team. Going into the season everyone thought we were the underdogs because we lost so many amazing seniors. But the fact that we've made it this far just proves how great of a team we have.\"\r\n\r\nComing into the playoffs, the Vikings were seeded third, even though they had more wins than St. Francis, the No. 2 seed. Saratoga, seeded fourth, beat the No. 1 seed Gunn, which was a big upset as Gunn had beaten Saratoga twice in the regular season.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings are going to the finals for the second year in a row, but last year they lost to St. Francis in triple overtime.\r\n\r\n\"I think we're all just so proud to have made it this far and Saturday is just going to be a test of how badly we really want it,\" Bara said. \"We know Saratoga is going to come out really hard and we have to really keep our focus if we want to become the SCVAL champions.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will face Saratoga at 10 a.m. on Saturday at the El Camino Field.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls' varsity lacrosse team (14-4) is preparing to take on Saratoga High School (14-5-1) in the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League final, which takes place at 10 a.m. Saturday at Paly.","date":"2014-05-15 13:41:45","author":"Callie Walker","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_0850.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"8736":"girls' lacrosse","8751":"gunn","8836":"Lacrosse","18836":"palo alto high school lacrosse","9063":"saratoga","18834":"scvals","18835":"semifinals","10253":"st. francis"}},{"id":71987,"title":"Boys and Girls Club to host Battle of the Bands","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/15\/boys-and-girls-club-to-host-battle-of-the-bands\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_71989\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"616\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/Screen-shot-2014-05-15-at-1.18.44-PM.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-71989\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/Screen-shot-2014-05-15-at-1.18.44-PM.png\" alt=\"The Boys and Girls Clubs of the Peninsula are hosting their event on May 18 in the Fox Theatre.

McNulty, who founded the Sports Literature elective class and is the adviser of both broadcast journalism class INfocus and sports magazine The Viking, will retire at the end of this school year after a 22\u00a0year-long career at Paly. A Sports in American Life speaker forum will be held in honor of his retirement.

According to librarian Rachel Kellerman, forum participants will also include Class of 2011\u00a0alumnus Wes Rapaport, who is pursuing a degree in broadcast journalism from Chapman University; junior Olivia Musil, athlete and McNulty's teacher practicum student; and senior student-athlete Keller Chryst,\u00a0who is committed to play at Stanford University as a quarterback this fall.\r\n\r\nAfter 22\u00a0years of teaching, McNulty plans on retiring at the end of the 2013-14 school year. McNulty founded the Sports Literature English elective in 2000 and is currently the adviser of both Paly's sports magazine The Viking and\u00a0daily broadcast journalism class INfocus.\r\n\r\nKellerman, along with teachers from the English Department, came up with the idea to host a Sports in American Life speaker forum\u00a0dedicated to McNulty.\r\n\r\n\"We wanted to do something to honor him [McNulty] in an intellectual, academic way since he started the Sports Literature class and it has been so popular at Paly,\" Kellerman said. \"He's also been involved in the sporting community. ... I was thinking that an interesting way to acknowledge Mr. McNulty, not just this year but [also] in years forward, would be to start a lecture talk about sports.\"\r\n\r\nSign-ups for the speaker forum can be found\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/1tua-9k6U7A0mu312m-eHKEfSXXIvFj-gkjio4DKwT8w\/viewform?edit_requested=true\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kellerman, the purpose of the forum is to highlight the function\u00a0of sports in society.\r\n\r\n\"One of the questions the speaker series will really try to answer is, 'Why do we talk about sports?'\" Kellerman said. \"It [the forum] has nothing to do with sports themselves, but with society and the role sports play in society.\"\r\n\r\nAs a farewell gift, McNulty said he will be donating a collection of roughly 600 to 700 books to the library. He began collecting when creating the Sports Literature class so that \"students would have access to outside reading material.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to McNulty, his only definite plans for retirement are to travel and to\u00a0remodel his home. However, he hopes to still be involved in the Paly community after retiring.\r\n\r\n\"I will still be the P.A. announcer for the football games in the fall, and I may have something to do with the Sports Pathway class [and] curriculum,\" McNulty said. \"I can't work for the [Palo Alto Unified School] District for the first 180 days following retirement. ... I may do some subbing as well. I'm also going to sleep a bit more.\"\r\n\r\nJunior Rowan McEvoy,\u00a0an Editor in Chief of The Viking, appreciates McNulty's role as a teacher and adviser to The Viking.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">\"Everyone is bummed out that Mac [McNulty] is retiring I think, especially the ones who have had him as a teacher,\" McEvoy said.\u00a0\"He has done an amazing job as an adviser to The Viking, especially this past year. He usually just lets the students run the show, but also adds in commentary when necessary. Even though he was only our adviser for one year, we will definitely miss him. Personally, I like him because he always says 'hi' to everyone and makes them feel like a special part of his classes.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nJunior Katie Gonzalez noted that McNulty's presence on campus will be missed.\r\n\r\n\"I was really sad when I finally heard that this was going to be Mac's last year of teaching at Paly,\" Gonzalez said. \"I had him for sophomore English and this semester for Sports Lit, and it's going to be weird not having him next year as a teacher or even seeing him on campus.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Kellerman, the format of the speaker forum may change in the upcoming years.\r\n\r\n\"He [McNulty] told me he always envisioned having a panel discussion,\" Kellerman said. \"So I think next year, we'll try and do something having more of a panel discussion and have it be during Tutorial.\"","excerpt":"In honor of teacher Mike McNulty's retirement, Palo Alto High School will host its first annual Sports in American Life speakers forum from 1:50 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. tomorrow in the new Media Arts Center.","date":"2014-05-14 23:27:01","author":"Lizzie Chun","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_0679.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"18369":"dave flemming","18368":"forum","9427":"infocus","18380":"katie gonzalez","8827":"keller chryst","18387":"livi musil","18366":"mac","18365":"mike mcnulty","18370":"retirement","18371":"retiring","18379":"rowan mcevoy","9115":"speaker","18367":"sports in american life","18381":"sports literature","9792":"viking","14173":"wes rapaport"}},{"id":71861,"title":"Slideshow: Softball trounces Fremont on Senior Night","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/14\/slideshow-softball-trounces-fremont-on-senior-night\/","content":"The Palo Alto Girls\u2019 softball team (14-12, 4-7) defeated\u00a0Fremont High School (3-22, 2-11) 8-3 after school Tuesday at home.

Erlich recorded an out on a ground ball\u00a0and\u00a0 then walked a batter before being replaced by junior Isaac Kasevich, who gave up six runs in 1.2\u00a0innings of relief work.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were being pretty cautious [with Erlich] just because he\u2019s coming off of an injury, and we didn\u2019t want to push it too much,\u201d head coach Erik Raich said.\r\n\r\nSaratoga pitcher Tyler Plesse went the distance, pitching the whole game while allowing only three runs.\r\n\r\nThe biggest blow for the Vikings came in the fourth inning when Saratoga had runners on second and third, and Kasevich gave up a two-run single.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey did a pretty good job offensively,\u201d Raich said. \u201cThey hit well against us.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings failed to capitalize with runners on base in the following innings, but Saratoga\u2019s defense played an error-free game including a stellar double play in the fifth inning.\r\n\r\nSenior Jack Cleasby finished the game 2-4 with two runs batted in on two singles.\r\n\r\nSophomore reliever Justin Hull closed out the game, throwing two innings and giving up two runs.\r\n\r\nAccording to Raich, Paly performed well but just came up short.\r\n\r\n\u201c[Our players] did everything we could have asked of them,\u201d Raich said. \u201cWe just got beat.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will look to avenge their loss when they travel to face Saratoga at 4 p.m. Thursday. \u00a0If the Vikings win, they will force a 4 p.m. game at home Friday.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School baseball team (15-13, 9-5) failed to hold a three-run lead and consequently fell to the Saratoga Falcons (20-8, 8-6) at home Tuesday by a final score of 8-4.","date":"2014-05-13 22:51:50","author":"Matthew Fogarty","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_0892.jpg","categories":["Baseball","Sports"],"tags":{"8410":"Baseball","8537":"Boys","8574":"Championships","18383":"injury","11716":"kasevich","18385":"lead","9884":"league","18382":"loss","18386":"lost","18384":"pless","9063":"saratoga"}},{"id":71725,"title":"Girls&#8217; lacrosse to square off against rival St. Francis in second round of playoffs","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/13\/girls-lacrosse-to-square-off-against-rival-st-francis-in-second-round-of-playoffs\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 lacrosse team (13-4, 12-1) is set to take on St. Francis High School (12-6, 10-2) in the second round of the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League playoffs at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at St. Francis High School.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings are coming off a first round victory against Leland High School (19-4), while the Lancers are coming off of a first round bye.
