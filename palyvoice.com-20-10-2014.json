Atanasov's educational background is focused on political science, and he has worked at the Macedonian Information Agency for five years, specializing in foreign policy. Photo by George Lu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTwo years ago in Skopje, the capital of the Republic of Macedonia, Atanasov came up with the idea to build a platform for Macedonian youth to voice their opinions and address issues relevant to their generation \u2013\u00a0the first of its kind in the nation. After spending four months in the United States, Atanasov left last week, ready to set his plan in motion.\r\n\r\nAtanasov\u2019s proposal to establish a Macedonia youth journalism association consists of multiple steps, including finding domestic and international organizations that are interested in supporting his idea. Once he finds enough backing, he will host discussions on youth journalism in Macedonia and officially form the association, working out the structural details, including\u00a0resource distribution.\r\n\r\nAtanasov divided his time in the U.S. evenly between working at the San Francisco Examiner and spending time at Paly to get both the professional and youth-centered sides of journalism that he hopes to bring together in his own project.\r\n\r\nAtanasov\u2019s initial plan was to focus on youth journalism in Skopje. However, after seeking out the advice of his friends in the field and Paul Kandell, a Paly journalism adviser (and adviser to The Paly Voice), Atanasov realized his idea would best serve the public by broadening his scope to all of Macedonia.\r\n\r\n\"The founding of the association would be more beneficial for the youth in Macedonia,\u201d Atanasov said. \u201cYou will have a place where anyone that [has] an idea to do something that will benefit the youth can be heard and can\u00a0get people that want to work with him or her in doing that and get the support and resources. ... It would [speed up] the process of advancing the youth media in the first place.\u201d\r\n\r\nMacedonia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, and Atanasov compared the state of press rights at that time to a \"free, wild-west\u00a0environment,\" with few regulations instated. Atanasov personally has not encountered the threat of censorship, which he partially attributes to his work in\u00a0international news\u00a0rather than domestic issues. Atanasov's positive experience with journalism while working\u00a0for the past five years at the Macedonian Information Agency, a public information and news service, influenced his proposal.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was lucky to end up in a working environment and doing the work [I] love,\u201d Atanasov said. \u201cIf I could provide something similar for as many students as possible, it would be a very rewarding thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_76118\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/10719518_951958934820904_284453896_n-copy.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-76118\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/10719518_951958934820904_284453896_n-copy.jpg\" alt=\"Atanasov observes The Paly Voice class.

Paly's first journalist in-residence, Atanasov initially considered creating a program similar to Voice with an online platform focused on local student news. However, the logistical and organizational details of the program will now be determined by the Macedonia youth journalism association that Atanasov\u00a0is in the process of establishing. Photo by George Lu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAs Paly\u2019s inaugural journalist in-residence, Atanasov expressed his appreciation of the guidance he received.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou [Paly] are open \u2013 [an important aspect is] not that you\u2019re leading in the United States or in California, but that you\u2019re also open to show the way or to lead someone to do similar things in other countries, like a role model,\u201d Atanasov said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just doing something, but also giving the chance for someone to participate and see how you\u2019re doing things, to learn from you.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring his time at Paly, Atanasov drew inspiration from not only the student publications, but also from how the MAC seemed to impact the way the publications are run. Despite the opportunities that the MAC presents, Atanasov recognizes that emulating the MAC in Macedonia will not be feasible for years to come.\r\n\r\n\"It [the MAC] serves [as] a good vision to follow, but it does not fit very well for a plan or a blueprint for a potential project in Macedonia,\u201d Atanasov said. \u201cYou need years and years of working and resolving things to come into a position to have a facility like this. I like what I see here, but I\u2019m more focused on what I can truly take and start from scratch in Macedonia.\u201d\r\n\r\nUltimately, Atanasov says he believes that once he gets his project started, the rest of the plan will fall into place.\r\n\r\n\"You will find really engaged students who want to learn, and there are a lot of stories that are untackled in the society,\u201d Atanasov said. \u201cThey [the students] will eventually be the first to write about some things that are happening, so it will be easy to get the readers after they [come] out with interesting stories.\"\r\n\r\nAtanasov imagines a future Macedonian\u00a0newsroom aflutter with students preparing for the production of Skopje\u2019s student newspaper. But it\u2019s not just in Skopje\u00a0\u2013 it\u2019s also in Bitola, Kumanovo and other cities all around the nation, all working to achieve the goals they have set forth for themselves, the same goals that Paly journalism strives for. After all, according to Atanasov, the new generations in the U.S. and Macedonia alike talk \u201cabout the same stories, TV series or the last movie that came out or what happened to [the] Kardashians\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it\u2019s the same.\" So why can\u2019t journalism be the same, too?","excerpt":"To some, the Palo Alto High School Media Arts Center has become a go-to hangout spot, a second home during production week or a prime place to take a nap.

During the team's most recent game, <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/02\/liveblog-football-vs-wilcox\/\">a 20-19 loss<\/a> against the Wilcox Chargers (4-1, 2-0), senior running back and captain Jayshawn Puckett exited early after suffering an apparent ankle injury during the third quarter.

After surrendering a total of 123 points in three games following the win at Sequoia, the Vikings defense held a tough Wilcox offense scoreless in the second half, forcing three fumbles. Despite falling short on the scoreboard, head coach Jake Halas is proud of the way his team competed hard at home after suffering back-to-back-to-back blow-out losses.\r\n\r\n\"I'm proud that our boys gave the student body a show,\" Halas said after the game. \"They deserve it. They come out every game and fill out their section, and I'm glad we put a show on for them.\"\r\n\r\nAs for this week, Halas was grateful for a bye week that provided rest and the opportunity to improve on overall technique in preparation for Friday's showdown of struggling teams.\r\n\r\n\"We practiced on getting better, just technique,\" Halas said. \"We got some of our guys healthy and are getting ready for Monta Vista. We expect to go in there and take care of business. Their record is identical to ours, but we need to go in there and dominate.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings and Matadors kick off at 7 p.m. this Friday at Monta Vista.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School football team (1-4, 0-1) will look to build off of a productive bye week as it receives another chance at a second victory on the season this Friday against Monta Vista High School (1-4, 0-2).","date":"2014-10-17 09:47:54","author":"Josh Yuen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Screen-Shot-2014-10-16-at-6.27.50-PM.png","categories":["Football","Sports"],"tags":[]}]
