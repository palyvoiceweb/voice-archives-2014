There were six rounds: the freshmen played the seniors and the sophomores played the juniors, followed by the finalists. In the boys' finals, the seniors\u00a0and sophomores played each other in a close game that resulted in\u00a0a\u00a0victory for the senior class.

Now, instead of a dance team consisting only of\u00a0five boys and five girls from each class, there is no maximum number of participants, and each grade's participant will automatically count as an additional point.
