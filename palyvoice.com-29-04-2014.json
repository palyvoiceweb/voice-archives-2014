The loss is the Vikings third straight, and more importantly eliminates them from any shot at a top seed in the De Anza League.\r\n\r\nThe Wildcats and the Wilcox Chargers are currently first and second seeds, respectively, heading into the league playoffs. The Vikings, in third, have been outscored 21-7 by their last three opponents.\r\n\r\nWhile seeding and momentum are key elements heading into the playoffs, sophomore pitcher and outfielder Justin Hull says his team needs to make adjustments.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was definitely a tough loss,\u201d Hull said. \u201cBut we want to come back on Friday, and do everything we can to beat Los Gatos.

Get it?\u00a0Photo by Gavin Libbey and Drew Keller[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWith Coachella finished\u00a0and Outside Lands tickets almost completely sold out, BottleRock music festival in Napa is one of the last major\u00a0in-state festivals of the season convenient for Palo Alto High School music lovers.\r\n\r\nThe festival will be held at the Napa Valley Expo over a three-day period, from Friday, May 30 to Sunday, June 1. School ends for Palo Alto Unified students on May 29, with seniors graduating on May 28, making BottleRock a perfect way to begin summer break.\r\n\r\nThe festival focuses on rock and alternative music, though it includes artists from a wide variety of other genres as well. While other big events such as Bonaroo, in Manchester, Tenn., and Coachella, in Indio have more of a presence from hip hop and electronic artists, hip hop artist Outkast will be headlining BottleRock. The festival\u00a0will also feature artists like LL Cool J and TV on the Radio.\r\n\r\nThe other headlining artists include country icon Eric Church and alternative\/goth rock band, The Cure. BottleRock features <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bottlerocknapavalley.com\/lineup\">over 45 artists total<\/a>, including many local groups.\r\n\r\nThe festival will kick off on Friday, May 30,\u00a0 with headlining\u00a0act The Cure. Other big names on Friday includes Sublime with Rome and the post-punk group TV on the Radio. Also look for Mayer Hawthorne and The Gin Blossoms.\r\n\r\nSaturday, May 31, features the reunited hip-hop duo Outkast. The accompanying performances are equally recognizable, with alt-rock legends Weezer and Palo Alto natives Third Eye Blind playing. And of course, no music festival would truly be complete without Smash Mouth (obviously the most influential and artistic of all the performances).\r\n\r\n\"I'm going because [of] Weezer,\" senior Riley Burt said.\r\n\r\nFor the Sunday, June 1 finale, country star Eric Church headlines a lineup of notable acts including The Fray, Deerhunter and Barenaked Ladies. Less famous but equally exciting acts include The Stone Foxes and Camper Van Beethoven.\r\n\r\nA significant number of groups at BottleRock recorded their biggest hits in the \u201890s and early 2000s, meaning the festival is likely to draw a slightly older audience than Coachella or Outside Lands.\r\n\r\nBottleRock is now in its second year after a moderately successful inaugural festival last summer. A change in management has stirred hopes that some of the issues with the first iteration, including poor food quality and financial issues, will be fixed this year.\r\n\r\nSingle-day passes cost $149 each when bought from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bottlerocknapavalley.com\/tickets\">the BottleRock website<\/a>,\u00a0with a $279 three-day pass available and increased prices for VIP privileges. Attendees will also have to pay additional parking and food costs.\r\n\r\nOne downside to the festival cited by some Paly students is its partial overlap with <a href=\"http:\/\/live105.cbslocal.com\/show\/bfd\/\">Live 105's BFD event<\/a>, which is to be held on Sunday, June 1 at Shoreline Amphitheater. The alternative music concert will feature Foster The People, M.I.A., Fitz and the Tantrums, Walk The Moon, and Flosstradamus and offers tickets at\u00a0relatively cheap prices.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Paly students such as senior Erik Danie plan to attend BottleRock, drawn by its lineup and nearby location.\r\n\r\n\"It'll be a fun time to hang out with friends\u00a0and it sounds like a good lineup,\" Danie said. \"I want a good way to start my summer.\"","excerpt":"With Coachella having finished up last weekend, and Outside Lands tickets almost completely sold out, the nearby  BottleRock music festival is one of the last major in-state festivals of the season convenient for Palo Alto High School music lovers.","date":"2014-04-24 13:43:55","author":"Drew Keller","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/bottlerock.jpg","categories":["Entertainment","Spotlight"],"tags":{"14810":"BottleRock","8613":"concert","8906":"music","8953":"paly","9137":"summer"}},{"id":70884,"title":"PTSA to focus on school climate in its last meeting of the year","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/23\/ptsa-to-hold-last-meeting-of-the-year\/","content":"The last Palo Alto High School Parent Teacher Student Association meeting of the year will focus on school climate and will take place at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow\u00a0in the English Resource Center.\r\n\r\nEric Bloom, a Social Studies and <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2013\/12\/20\/school-climate-teacher-to-start-2nd-semester\/\" target=\"_blank\">School Climate teacher on special assignment<\/a>, will be speaking at this meeting about his new position.\r\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0\"I'm going to be there to explain what the position is and what we have done this year and to answer questions,\" Bloom said.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Bloom's position was created earlier this year to create a more welcoming environment at Paly.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">PTSA Vice President of Programs and Parent Education Jennifer Landesman noted that the meeting is open to\u00a0all Paly parents.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">\"The upcoming\u00a0PTSA General Meeting is structured in a way where business items of the PTSA board are first covered during the first few minutes, and afterwards a speaker is invited to present,\" Landesman said in an email to The Paly Voice. \"All parents, not just the board parents, are encouraged to attend, as these programs have interesting and informative programs about what's going on at Paly.\"<\/p>","excerpt":"The last Parent Teacher Student Association meeting of the year will be held at 8:30 a.m. this Thursday in the English Resource Center.\r\n","date":"2014-04-23 21:30:16","author":"Callie Walker","categories":["News"],"tags":{"14846":"becca","14845":"callie","14852":"cat","14850":"climate","14847":"cute","11236":"eric bloom","14851":"fun","14853":"jennifer landesman","10043":"meeting","14849":"mr bloom","9019":"PTSA","14848":"ptsa meetinge","10609":"school climate","14854":"social studies teacher"}},{"id":70879,"title":"Students to give back to community on Paly Service Day","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/23\/students-to-give-back-to-community-on-paly-service-day\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_70938\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"312\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/service-day.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-70938 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/service-day.jpg\" alt=\"Paly Service Day is taking place for the whole day on Thursday on and off campus.

Some students will be dismissed from school for the day to work on off-campus projects, and others will be able\u00a0to contribute to their community just the same through a variety of\u00a0on-campus activities.\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of ways the students can help for the off-campus service. The activities\u00a0range from\u00a0going to Acterra to clean up the Bay Trail to going to Sunrise Assisted Living to spend time with the senior citizens, according to freshman and Service Day Committee member Candace Wang.\r\n\r\nOn the campus, there will be different activities available to the students. During lunch, there will be booths out on the Quad, and different school clubs will have awareness talks and side service projects going on throughout the day. Habitat for Humanity is also coming to Paly to guide students in building playhouses, according to Wang.\r\n\r\n\"There are a lot of clubs [participating], and what we [Service Day Committee] want them to do is set up booths to talk about either awareness or about projects they can or are doing to help with service and volunteering,\" Wang said.\r\n\r\nThere will be a service day breakfast\u00a0and a speech by Principal Kim Diorio at 7:45 a.m. for students taking part in service day.

Photo by Paige Esterly.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIf you run into your English teacher in your math class, no, it's not because Ms. X wants to brush up her algebra skills. In an effort to open up communication between students and teachers, School Climate Committee head Eric Bloom is working to assign teachers different students to shadow for an average school day, an effort that will continue throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bloom, Principal Kim Diorio originally encouraged departmental Instructional Supervisors, as well as Western Association of Schools and Colleges focus group leaders, to participate in the shadowing program. However, once the idea was pitched, other teachers came to Bloom expressing interest as well.\r\n\r\nBloom's job here is to pair teachers and students. Once a teacher comes to Bloom, he or she may request a grade level to shadow. From there, Bloom finds an appropriate student for the specific teacher, striving to find a range of course loads and extra curricular activities.\r\n\r\n\"What we're really trying to get them to do is follow a real schedule,\" Bloom said.\r\n\r\nBloom believes that by shadowing students, teachers will gain insight into the lives of high schoolers, a sentiment echoed by World History teacher and history department IS, Jacyln Edwards.\r\n\r\nEdwards, who teaches freshmen, believes that her experience shadowing a student will directly impact her future teaching decisions.\r\n\r\n\"I already altered one of my assignments because I was a freshman so I followed a freshman schedule,\" she said. \"Many of the students I have I was also in their classes and I came to realize that they had some other things that were due this week.

Today, these boys will face off against each other representing their respective schools, as the Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 golf team (11-0) takes on its crosstown rival Gunn High School (10-1) in San Jose.\r\n\r\nPracticing on the same course and living in the same community as the Gunn players, the Paly team sees the matchup as not just a battle for first place in league, but for bragging rights: the Paly boys have earned an undefeated record, winning all 10 of their matches thus far, while the Gunn golfers\u2019 only loss came on March 25 when they fell to the Vikings, 187-179.\r\n\r\nPaly junior John Knowles acknowledged the heightened level of personal pride involved in competing against the team\u2019s crosstown rival.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe upcoming Gunn match doesn\u2019t have any significant playoff importance, but it\u2019s more of a pride thing, as we practice at the same place as the Gunn team,\u201d Knowles said. \u201cIn addition, it is always nice to finish undefeated and so that will be an added motivation.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of Paly\u2019s major strengths lies in its depth, sophomore Henry Gordon said.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have a very deep team,\u00a0so if our top players struggle one day, our lower ranked players can still contend with other top players from other teams,\u201d Gordon said.\r\n\r\nKnowles agreed that the team\u2019s overall talent gives it an edge over its opponent.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have 10 solid guys who have the ability to play very well,\u201d Knowles said. \u201cIn the matches, we all have a shot to win medalist or get the low score, so I think we are driven to not only beat the other team, but beat the guys on our team as well.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile their sheer talent is undeniable, a secret to the Vikings\u2019 success may lie in their team chemistry, according to Knowles.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs far as I know, everyone on the team likes everyone else, and I personally enjoy spending time with the team,\u201d Knowles said. \u201cI'm not sure how much this contributes to our success, but it makes matches more enjoyable when you like spending time with the teammate you're playing with.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings also rely on their teammates to push each other and keep each other focused and motivated, according to Paly junior Alex Hwang.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think having some sort of competition for playing the top spots on the team motivates us to give more effort, especially in matches that we may beat the opponent by a large margin in,\u201d Hwang said. \u201cTo some extent, there's more competition between members of our team to post a low score than with the other team.\u201d\r\n\r\nMost recently, the Vikings defeated the Homestead Mustangs, 218-195, yesterday to improve to an 11-0 record. Paly plans to maintain its perfect record by bringing its competitive attitude into the rematch with Gunn this afternoon.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we're all confident in our ability to beat Gunn,\u201d Hwang said. \u201cHaving confidence in the others members of the team plays a big role in our individual confidence and not making us too nervous.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings tee off against the Titans at 3 p.m. today at the Santa Teresa Golf Club in San Jose.\r\n\r\n<em><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/author\/jaschwartz14\/\">Jared Schwartz<\/a> contributed to this story.<\/em>","excerpt":"After earning an undefeated record going into the end of the regular season, the Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 golf team (10-0) is preparing to take on cross-town rival Gunn High School (10-1) Tuesday at the Santa Teresa Golf Club.","date":"2014-04-22 12:48:49","author":"Allison Cowie","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/golfclubs2.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"14524":"alex hwang","14522":"gunn golf","14525":"henry gordon","14526":"john knowles","14523":"palo alto high school boys golf","14521":"paly golf"}},{"id":70831,"title":"Paly theater students to showcase original plays tonight","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/21\/paly-theater-students-to-showcase-original-plays-tonight\/","content":"Eight Palo Alto High School theater students will be presenting their original 10-minute plays at 7 p.m.\u00a0tonight at the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts.\r\n\r\nAfter two months of workshopping with their peers, the eight students will get a chance to showcase their work in collaboration with professional actors and directors.\r\n\r\n\"Every playwright gets an hour and a half to work with the directors and the actors,\" junior playwright Molly Mackris said. \"We get to workshop the script with the actors and make final adjustments and at the end we get to present it.\"\r\n\r\nMackris has really enjoyed the process of workshopping her play with her peers.\r\n\r\n\"It\u2019s been a lot of fun so far,\" Mackris said. \"I love playwriting and working with other people who have opinion and its been really benefical.\"\r\n\r\nSophomore playwright Clara Baker also agrees with Mackris on the workshopping process.\r\n\r\n\"I love writing,\" Baker said. \"It was a fun process having people read through my play and giving it detailed feedback.\"\r\n\r\nBaker also thinks highly of the event as a way for Paly students to show their artistic talents.\r\n\r\n\"Just because we\u2019re young and still in school doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t create art that is comparable to the creations of artists that work in the professional world, and this is tangible evidence of that,\" Baker said.\r\n\r\nMackris strongly encourages Paly students to attend to the unique event for a variety of reasons.\r\n\r\n\"Admission is free,\" Mackris said. \"All the plays are really interesting and they've come a long way since the beginning.
