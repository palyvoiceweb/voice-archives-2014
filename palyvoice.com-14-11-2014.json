There are weekly tastings of tea flavors and additions to make the store seem more communal. The syrups and almond jelly are made from scratch, and almost everything is organic, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bobaguys.com\" target=\"_blank\">Boba Guys\u00a0website<\/a>.\r\n\r\nI ordered a drink with almond milk because Boba Guys is one of the few places I\u2019ve been to that has a dairy free option, and I wanted to take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nThe server was generous with the pearls, which were very chewy and flavorful and did not disintegrate. The tea flavor was very strong, but the drink was incredibly sweet. At certain points, some sips would be almost unbearably sweet if the syrup wasn\u2019t completely mixed in.\r\n\r\nA downfall was the slow service, but Boba Guys does call the drinks the \"Slow Bar\" in warning. Also, the drink was served with a snap-on\u00a0lid. Some people may not understand the importance of this, but without a vacuum sealed lid, it is impossible to shake the drink into a perfect mixture with no too-sweet spots.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Boba Delight<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<address style=\"font-weight: inherit;\"><span style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;\">528 Larkin St.,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;\">San Francisco<\/span>,\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;\">94102<\/span><\/address>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_76781\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9884.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-76781 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9884.jpg\" alt=\"Boba Delight was very sweet and watery.

It\u2019s relatively new, and you can purchase glass bottles to bring in again for a discount. Boba Delight also has a stamping rewards system that gives you a free drink after you buy 10 drinks.\r\n\r\nI personally will\u00a0not return and do not recommend that anyone try it. The service was very slow, and once I finally received my drink, I was less than impressed.\r\n\r\nThe drink was incredibly sweet and super syrupy. At the time time, it seemed like they used water instead of milk because it was so thin and not at all creamy. I could not mix the drink to see if it was just mixed poorly because it had a snap-on\u00a0lid.\r\n\r\nThe pearls were very soft and would often clog up the straw. They started to disintegrate quickly and would leave a tapioca pearl residue on the sides of the cup. Everything seemed very artificial, and I could barely tell if they gave me the flavor I asked for.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Quickly<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<em>300 Walnut St.,\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: inherit;\">Redwood City<\/span>,\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: inherit;\">Calif.,<\/span>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: inherit;\">94063<\/span><\/em>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_76779\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9888.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-76779\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9888.jpg\" alt=\"Quickly was not very flavorful but the service was very fast and the sizes are large.

I would personally call it the McDonald\u2019s of pearl milk tea places. I have had Quickly on multiple occasions, and I have never been particularly impressed. This location was no exception.\r\n\r\nIt has very fast service, large cup sizes and many options for mix-ins. I chose the usual tapioca pearls which were large and very chewy. The pearls did not leave remnants in the cup, but coated the inner straw and mouth. In general, the drink was sweet, very milky and not very flavorful.\r\n\r\nThe straws were not wrapped, which I have never seen before and made me a little suspicious. Quickly uses the FIVESTARS reward card system and is cash only. I would say that if you can find a flavor you like, go because it\u2019s cheap, but be aware that it\u2019s not very good either.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Plentea<\/strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_76782\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9927.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-76782 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9927.jpg\" alt=\"Plentea did not have many flavor options but what it did have was delicious.

All drinks are served in cool glass containers, and the store will give you a 10 percent discount if brought back. The bottles also have a lid for transportation and reusability.\r\n\r\nThere was a line out the door that\u00a0was very slow moving, but once you\u2019ve ordered, the drinks come quickly. There are few flavor options, but there are fruit drinks, smoothies, teas and many combinations of all of these.\r\n\r\nThe tea was very flavorful with large, soft pearls. The drink was very creamy and because there was no flavoring, there was no mixing required for a perfectly smooth drink. The texture was even throughout the bottle, which I very much appreciated.\r\n\r\n<i>Please leave a comment to suggest Pearl Milk Tea places you would like reviewed.\u00a0<\/i>","excerpt":"Staff writer Alex Merkle-Raymond takes the PMT challenge to San Francisco where she experiences the best and worst PMT she's ever had.

In a competition for the second open seat and with the provisional ballots uncounted, Crystal-Foster trailed 199 votes behind Godfrey at last count, and the \"uncounted ballots are unlikely to change the outcome,\" Crystal-Foster said in an email to her campaign staff and supporters.\r\n\r\nHere is the full text of her email announcement:\r\n\r\n\"We've all been watching the living lesson that every vote truly counts in our democracy. At this point, the county has recorded all remaining vote-by-mail ballots, and there are only a few thousand uncounted provisional ballots remaining county-wide. Ken Dauber has secured one school board seat, and Terry Godfrey is ahead of me by 199 votes for the second seat. The uncounted ballots are unlikely to change the outcome, so I offer my sincere congratulations to Ken and Terry as the new members of our school board. Both Terry and Ken will be staunch advocates for our students, and I wish them both the best. I have great regard for the talent and dedication that all the candidates brought to this race. My best to Gina Dalma and Jay Cabrera, as well, who share a commitment to education and will, I'm confident, continue their good work on behalf of students. I look forward to continuing my service to the schools and our students, and will do so in a spirit of collaboration with all our school leaders.\r\n\r\n\"I am grateful for the opportunity to have spent these past six months discussing the future of Palo Alto\u2019s schools with so many in our community. I continue to be energized by you, by the opportunities before us, and by the ambition of our new superintendent. To those of you who walked, called, endorsed, created, gave, wrote, informed, and inspired over this campaign -- many, many thanks. We created a network of positive thinkers who care about education that will continue long after the final ballots are counted.\r\n\r\n\"I am privileged to have been surrounded and supported by so many wonderful friends and neighbors in this journey. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.\"\r\n\r\nAn announcement on Crystal-Foster's Facebook page reads:\r\n\r\n\"The last vote-by-mail ballots have been counted, and Ken has retained the first school board seat and Terry is ahead of me by 199 votes for the second. While provisional ballots remain uncounted, it is unlikely that those will change the outcome. Thus, I've reached out to Ken and Terry to congratulate them as our new school board members. They both care deeply about students and I wish them the\u00a0very best. To each and every one of you, I offer my deepest thanks for all your hard work, belief in our positive and forward-looking message, and for your friendship and support. I feel privileged to have worked with such a wonderful team and look forward to continuing to work with you in our schools and community for the benefit of all our students.\"","excerpt":"The contest for the remaining seat on the Palo Alto school board came to an end this morning when Catherine Crystal-Foster announced today that she is pulling out of the race.","date":"2014-11-13 11:28:08","author":"Adele Bloch","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/rsz_img_7834.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"12701":"2014","32676":"catherine crystal-foster","32598":"crystal-foster","29789":"dauber","8667":"elections","29787":"godfrey","8828":"ken dauber","32677":"palo alto school board","9069":"School Board","32674":"terry godfrey","32675":"votes","9219":"voting"}},{"id":78474,"title":"Vikings to close out regular season at Saratoga","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/11\/12\/vikings-to-close-out-regular-season-at-saratoga\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School football team (3-6, 2-3) looks\u00a0to finish out its regular season with a critical victory when it faces the Saratoga High School Falcons (4-5, 2-3) this Friday on the road with potential Central Coast Section playoff implications at stake.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_78532\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Screen-Shot-2014-11-10-at-8.40.13-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-78532\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Screen-Shot-2014-11-10-at-8.40.13-PM.png\" alt=\"Junior quarterback Justin Hull surveys his receivers downfield during a 55-26 victory against the Santa Clara Bruins on Oct. 31. as junior Mikey Grandy and senior Jon Martinez protect him.

According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.va.gov\/opa\/vetsday\/vetdayhistory.asp\">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs<\/a>, President Wilson said, \"To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country\u2019s service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of the nations...\"\r\n\r\nThe name changed after World War II in which\u00a0the largest amount of soldiers, marines and airmen were deployed in national history. Since then, Nov. 11 was officially renamed to Veterans Day to commemorate all American veterans who represented their country in a time of war.\r\n\r\nSo let's stop complaining that Veterans Day falls on a Tuesday this year and that we didn't have Monday off as well. Veterans Day should not be about the long weekend. It should be about remembering and honoring those who have committed and given their lives in the name of our country.\r\n\r\nYesterday the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Robert McDonald, announced a major restructuring of the VA department. These plans come in response to an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/va-moves-to-fire-4-senior-executives-due-to-scandal\/\">incident<\/a>\u00a0that left over a hundred thousand veterans waiting painstakingly long for access to healthcare, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2014\/11\/10\/politics\/va-reforms-and-restructuring\/index.html\">CNN<\/a>. Veterans, even with their hard work for our country, often fall through the cracks of employment or healthcare when they return home.\r\n\r\nYes, it is nice to have a day off. However, we should not ignore the true intent behind this day in history. I encourage all to take a break from catching up on their favorite shows or doing homework on Tuesday to be thankful for those who have dedicated their lives to protect ours. Don't just take this free time for granted, because the soldiers we commemorate did not always have that luxury.","excerpt":"People look forward to a random day with no work and no school as extra time to relax.
