Photo by Callie Walker.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWith Advanced Placement tests are right around the corner, many Palo Alto High School juniors are likely wondering how they should prepare for their first round of AP testing. Having taken AP tests last year, the Voice's own Jared Schwartz and Becca Raffel offer their two cents on advice to prepare, and several other seniors as well as AP U.S. History teacher Jack Bungarden join the conversation.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, many people greatly overestimate the need to frantically prepare for these examinations, and\u00a0they forget one crucial element: they\u00a0have been preparing for the exam all year.\r\n\r\nWhy did you read every chapter of <em>American Pageant<\/em>? And learn how to use a voice recorder in Spanish? And diligently participate in all the biology labs?\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is, AP tests are made to reflect\u00a0what you have learned all year, not how much content you can cover in the next few days. Staying focused all year is crucial to success on the tests, according to senior Sarah Ohlson.\r\n\r\n\"Your teachers prepared you well throughout the year and as long as you stayed focused first semester you will do well second semester,\" Ohlson said.\r\n\r\nDon't get us wrong \u2013 a little spot review on areas that you might have forgotten is a great plan, but there is no need to go overboard with it. AP U.S. History teacher Jack Bungarden addresses the importance of reviewing.\r\n\r\n\"Study,\" Bungarden said. \"Go to review sessions, review your notes, go back and look at class materials, review the stuff you learned back in first semester. \u00a0Take some practice exams.\"\r\n\r\nPurchasing an AP practice booklet can also be beneficial, according to senior Jack Shapiro.\r\n\r\n\"It's really important to buy an AP test prep book if you can,\" Shapiro said. \"They have lots of tips on what problems you'll find and face and what you should review. \u00a0It's definitely worth it to get one to at least practice.\"\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of AP testing that is overlooked is the huge curve on the test. Depending on what AP class you're in, chances are that you have been taking simulated AP tests all year and have been receiving your raw grades on them. On the AP test, that C you have could\u00a0turn into a 5.\r\n\r\n<em>Three suggested\u00a0steps to dominating the test:<\/em>\r\n\r\n1. Pick out the topics that you have struggled with or haven't seen in a while. Make flashcards or have a friend explain them to you.\r\n\r\n2. Briefly skim over all the other material to remind yourself how much you know.\r\n\r\n3. Relax, get a good night's sleep and enter the test with confidence! \"Always choose sleep over study,\" senior Anthony Lim said.\r\n\r\nAll in all, we would like to stress the importance of not stressing about the tests. Sure, do some review and make sure you know your stuff, but\u00a0getting worked up about the tests is neither necessary nor beneficial.\r\n\r\n\"Take it easy and relax about it, it's not a big deal,\" senior Jonathan Mackris said. \"Paly prepares you well for the AP's.\"","excerpt":"With Advanced Placement tests are right around the corner, many Palo Alto High School juniors are likely wondering how they should prepare for their first <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/04\/how-to-prepare-for-ap-testing\/#more-'\" class=\"more-link\">more &raquo;<\/a>","date":"2014-05-04 21:21:50","author":"Becca Raffel","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/Screen-shot-2014-04-29-at-1.07.21-PM.png","categories":["Opinion"],"tags":[]},{"id":71319,"title":"One Acts showcase humor, drama, talent of Theater program","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/02\/one-acts-showcase-humor-drama-talent-of-theater-program\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_71329\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/photo.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-71329\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/photo.jpg\" alt=\"The Theater program's One Acts this year include three original scripts written by Paly students, two adapted scripts, and an improvisational performance.

Photo by Gavin Libbey[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe annual Palo Alto High School Theater class's One Acts plays allow the program to showcase its students' skills in acting, writing and directing for the stage. After a successful first show, this year's series of short performances have proven once again to be a fun and amusing with a\u00a0diverse lineup.\r\n\r\nThe One Acts showcase is\u00a0the Theater program's last show of the school year and consists of several short plays acted, directed and, in some cases, written by Paly Theater students. Compared to the bigger productions put on earlier in the year, the One Acts performances are quaint and simple, but that is what gives them their charm. Besides, those descriptions probably don't do justice to all the time and work spent on the plays, which makes them even more impressive.\r\n\r\nThis year's lineup includes three original plays written by Paly students, two adapted scripts and a performance by the Paly Improv Troupe.\r\n\r\nThe Improv Troupe, led by senior Marcus Edholm, starts the night off with two rounds of \"foursquare.\" The improv game has four performers organize themselves in a square and rotate at the order of an outside leader. The duo facing the audience starts a scene with each other, but when the leader orders them to rotate, the scene is paused and the new duo starts a different scenario. All the scenes must include a key word given by the audience and must persist between similar duos.\r\n\r\nThe four rapidly-changing stories can get wild and bizarre, but make for some great spontaneous laughs. As with all improv acts there were hits and misses, but the actors stuck to their scenes and characters regardless of whatever strange tangent their partner sent them on, and I enjoyed watching their impromptu stories develop on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe first written performance is \"Tell Me a Story,\" written by senior Curtis Wu and directed by Edholm. In it, sophomore Paul Bleich's stressed and caffeine-addicted character Chris calls upon his cooler, smarter friend Jake, played by sophomore Ophir Sneh, to help him with\u00a0his Psychology course thesis by having him tell Chris three stories to psychoanalyze\u00a0despite not\u00a0having three real cases\u00a0to study.\r\n\r\nHowever, whenever Jake begins a story, the focus shifts to a different scene about a man named Mark, played by junior Guive Assadi, actually being psychoanalyzed by his psychologist Joan, played by sophomore\u00a0Adele Bloch. Mark then tells the story, and the play once again shifts to Sneh acting as the characters Assadi describes. The result is interestingly meta and works as a fantastic way to study characters and personas. My only complaint is that it ended so soon because it would have only improved with more time.\r\n\r\nThe next play, \"Doors,\" is\u00a0written\u00a0by sophomore Charlotte Moffat and directed by junior Sabrina Sonner. The story follows a librarian named Cora, played by junior Riley Cassidy, who has a strange encounter in her quiet, unassuming workplace. A mysterious reoccurring figure, played by freshman Erin Reynolds, claims to be Janus, the Roman god of doors, endings and transitions. The events of the play are rather simple, mostly consisting of Cora's interactions with Janus and her interpretations of them being bounced off her friend, but the conclusion takes a turn for the confusing and intriguing. I don't think I got it entirely, but its crypticness is what made this play special.\r\n\r\n\"Sure Thing\" is the first adapted script of the night, written by David Ives and directed by freshman\u00a0Jason Pollak. The premise is simple: Bill, played by junior Will Kast, attempts to court junior Madison Mignola's character\u00a0Betsy,\u00a0who is reading a book alone in a cafe. Every time either one of them screws up or says something awkward, a girl with an assortment of loud instruments, played by freshman Leanne Miron, interjects with a noise and resets the scene at Bill's last successful chatting point.\r\n\r\nIt's a hilarious script, with plenty of clever gags and a neat, fast pacing. The three actors nailed the timing of their lines and cues, undoubtedly with the help of their director. \"Sure Thing\" could have gone\u00a0poorly very easily, but the dedication to precision and accuracy was what made this adaptation so much fun to watch and my favorite play of the night.\r\n\r\nAfter an intermission, it's time for the next adapted script \"The Six of Calais.\" Written by George Bernard Shaw and directed by senior Aaron Slipper, this play tells the story of the Burghers of Calais (immortalized and exhibited on the Stanford campus by master sculptor Auguste Rodin). The Burghers were six town elders of the French hold Calais, who sacrificed themselves to the English King Edward III, played by freshman\u00a0Johnny Rohrbach, for the safety of their city.\r\n\r\nIt's the longest and biggest play of the night, with a cast of twelve and two Medieval-style war tents flanking the stage. The play is surprisingly humorous for an event typically depicted as somber. Slipper did do the event some dramatic justice throughout his adaptation, especially during the scenes between King Edward and the more defiant Burghers. The only big issue was the projector, which displayed slides of semi-related pieces of art throughout the play. It felt unnecessary and distracting when it overshadowed the performers.\r\n\r\nThe last performance is \"Foul Play,\"\u00a0written by senior Dashiel Grusky and directed by sophomore\u00a0Molly Kraus. It's the most tongue-in-cheek script by far, telling the story of a county fair's best-in-show competition for donkeys. Ryan, played by junior Ido Gal, loves his perfect donkey Harold, played by freshman\u00a0Joey Kellison-Linn, but despises his business associate Rosemary, played by senior Aida Goma-Petite. They have to work together in the most convoluted way possible to defeat Ryan's rival and his schemes involving a parrot. I still don't quite get how a parrot could pass as a donkey and vice versa, but it's the fact that all the characters understand this as a seemingly typical thing that makes it humorous. It was a silly, fun way to end the night.\r\n\r\nThe variety and talent in all the plays is impressive and speaks to the strength of Paly's Theater program and its members. The quick bursts of drama, comedy and intrigue kept me entertained throughout, and it was easily worth the easy two hours it ran for.\r\n\r\nOne Acts are playing again Friday May 2 and Saturday May 3 at 7:30 p.m. in the Haymarket Theater. Tickets cost $5 for students and $7 for adults.","excerpt":"The final show of the year put on by the Palo Alto High School theater program is an impressive display of writing and acting by Paly students and is something everyone and anyone can enjoy.

Photo by Maddy Jones.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 lacrosse team (10-4, 9-1) earned redemption after beating the Gunn High School Titans (12-2, 9-1) in a hard-fought match, 10-9, Wednesday at Paly.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings are now sitting in third place in the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League, while Gunn still holds on to first place.\r\n\r\nDespite the Titans scoring the first two goals of the game, Paly was able to strike back quickly with a goal from sophomore midfielder Maya Benatar, which gave momentum to the Viking offense. Both halfs of the game were toughly contested, with the difference in goals never passing two. While Gunn threatened Paly with fast breaks, the Viking defense stayed patient and blocked several opportunities for a Titan advantage.\r\n\r\nThe cross-town match brought a level of physical aggression that caused both teams to give up key goals due to fouls. Paly senior midfielder Kristen DeStefano scored the last goal of the first half after a Gunn player illegally checked her, resulting in her being sent off of the field with a yellow card.\r\n\r\nWhile defense was a highly emphasised component of this match, both teams excelled offensively, with Titan captain Victoria Nguyen scoring one-third (three) of their goals. Viking junior midfielder Paige Bara responded by scoring an impressive four goals, one of which gave Paly their tenth and winning goal.\r\n\r\nWhile Paly finished the first half with a lead of 7-5, Gunn came back in the 2nd, tying it up 8-8 with 15 minutes to go. During these first 10 minutes, the Titans displayed their athleticism as they pivoted and sprinted with great endurance across the field, waiting for an opening in the Paly defense. Viking sophomore goalie Meredith Kinnaman successfully blocked earlier attempts by the Titan offense, but Gunn\u2019s patience was eventually rewarded, bringing the score to 8-8.\r\n\r\nPaly, determined to put an end to Gunn\u2019s comeback, attentively watched as the Titan\u2019s offense advanced. Gunn midfielders walked back and forth across the field, seemingly taunting the Vikings to make the first move. Paly intercepted the ball and brought it down the field where junior attacker Lauren Gargiulo scored, putting the Vikings back on top.\r\n\r\nIt was apparent that as time on the clock decreased, the intensity increased, as players of both teams desperately fought for possession of the ball. Gunn gained control and in fast break made their way towards the goal, only to be met with fierce opposition by the Viking defense. Almost mechanically, the Gunn offense reset, returning to their style of patience. Gunn midfielder Annie Vesey saw her chance and struck, pivoting and spinning she executed a powerful shot and scored.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was in the moment, it was all instinct,\u201d Vesey said. \u201cAll I was thinking was maybe we can win this.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Viking defense held-off the last attempts of a determined Titan line-up, earning redemption for their loss to Gunn in March.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were not prepared for Gunn\u2019s skills in the first game. This time we knew how they played,\u201d Bara said. \u201cI think we just came into the game with the right mindset and did a much better job communicating on defense.\u201d\r\n\r\nEven though the Vikings walked away with a victory, Coach Jamie Nesbitt is already looking for ways they can improve.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are a lot of areas for improvement,\u201d Nesbitt said. \u201cI think for us, in close games, it comes down to little things like the defensive presence at the end and the urgency to get the ball to the attacking end.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings\u2019 next game is against Saint Francis High School (10-3, 9-1) at 7 p.m. Friday night at Palo Alto High School.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 lacrosse team (10-4, 9-1) earned redemption after beating the Gunn High School Titans (12-2, 9-1) in a hard-fought match, 10-9, Wednesday at Paly.

The Parade is the oldest children\u2019s parade in Northern California. This year\u2019s theme for the event is \u201cLet Me Be Your Neighbor,\u201d according to parade event planner Ali Williams.\r\n\r\nAll of the public middle and high schools of Palo Alto are performing in the parade. During the parade, multiple groups will be marching through the streets, including the Viking Pep Band from Palo Alto High School. The Viking Pep Band will be playing the song \u201cIn the Stone\u201d by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, according to band member and junior Andrew Lu.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got tons of spirit when it comes to playing outside,\u201d Lu said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do yells and cheers, and we have the signature kick during the drum cadence.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile Lu has participated in the Parade in past years for the marching band, he has also attended the event with his family when he was younger, according to Lu.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really great community event [and] brings everyone in town together,\u201d Lu said. \u201cThe groups are diverse, ranging from musicians to martial artists to middle schoolers who\u2019ve built go-carts at school.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring the parade, eight floats are going to compete for the Palo Alto Weekly Awards, along with clowns, stilt walkers, hula artists and other entertainers who will participate\u00a0in the parade. Different schools, youth groups, dance teams and sports teams will also march in the parade, according to Williams.\r\n\r\n\u201cNumerous preschool groups and elementary schools are joining the fun to show school pride,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe parade kicks off with the motorcycle police and ends with the shiny fire engine.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlong with those showing their spirit for the town, there will also be groups who are promoting their organization. The Palo Alto Children\u2019s Theater will be promoting their upcoming performance and the Humane Society will be walking through the parade, showcasing local pets in need.

The Milpitas boys' team (0-5) is in seventh, and the girls (1-4) are in fifth.\r\n\r\nSophomore sprinter Eli Givens believes the team will build\u00a0off of the momentum gained from its recent win against Los Altos.\r\n\r\n\"We all did a good job of making our way up to where we are now,\" Givens said. \"We're all going to do pretty well because it's the last meet, so we're all going to have that feeling that we need to give it our all.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to sophomore mid-distance runner Portia Barrientos, the girls' team plans on changing up its lineup to give athletes\u00a0the opportunity to try out new events.\r\n\r\n\"Milpitas as a team is not as strong as the other teams that we've had meets against, so at this meet, we're having people try different events to see if we can get different results,\" Barrientos said.\r\n\r\nThis year, the track team has also overcome a variety of issues, such as the introduction of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/03\/03\/season-preview-new-coaches-to-keep-team-on-track-and-field\/\" target=\"_blank\">new coaches<\/a>, the prevalence of injuries and the loss of senior runners. Boys' head coach Kelsey Feeley reflected on the regular season regarding the team's recovery.\r\n\r\n\"For the most part, everyone's healthy now,\" Feeley said. \"That was definitely a big issue at the beginning of the season \u2013 people\u00a0coming off of injuries or getting injured.\"\r\n\r\nBarrientos noted that injuries have hindered the girls' season.\r\n\r\n\"On the girls' side, a lot of injuries have gotten in the way of our runners' performances,\" Barrientos said. \"It's really hard to come back from injuries.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the loss of seniors, the team has had to count on the younger runners this year, according to Feeley.\r\n\r\n\"Mostly on the boys' side, it was a big rebuilding year,\" Feeley said.\u00a0\"We lost a lot of talented boys to graduation last year\u00a0\u2013\u00a0more or less our jumping and sprinting crew \u2013 but we've had some kids really step up when they needed to, fill in spots and rise to the occasion.\"\r\n\r\nA lack of throwers has also contributed to a difficult season, according to senior captain Nick Sullivan.\r\n\r\nHowever, Feeley is confident about the team's trajectory concerning post-season meets, including leagues, Santa Clara Valley Athletic League and Central Coast Section events.\r\n\r\n\"I\u00a0feel great going into leagues,\" Feeley said. \"Both of our relays are pretty solid right now, especially our 4x400 [relay], and we even have a few alternates for those races.\"\r\n\r\nFeeley believes that the following meets will give runners the opportunity to shine after a season of hard work.\r\n\r\n\"Individually, we have a lot of kids who are peaking at the right time,\" Feeley said. \"For the older kids, it's a time for them to show what they've been working at all season and will be a good practice for upcoming meets after leagues, such as SCVAL and CCS, and even States for some kids.\"","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School track and field teams are looking to win their upcoming meet at 3:15 p.m. today at Milpitas High School and prepare for post-season meets after a challenging season performance.","date":"2014-05-01 14:39:18","author":"Lizzie Chun","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/track5.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"15412":"de anza","15411":"leagues","8889":"milpitas","8944":"palo alto high school","15101":"season update","9120":"sports","9181":"track","9183":"track and field"}},{"id":71274,"title":"Badminton Preview: Paly seeks to defeat Gunn a second time","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/01\/badminton-preview-paly-seeks-to-defeat-gunn-a-second-time\/","content":"Palo Alto High School\u2019s badminton team (3-5) will face its cross-town rival Henry M.

We have everything from a newspaper (The Campanile) to a foreign policy magazine (Agora) and everything in between. So what's next for Paly journalism? A radio show? \u00a0A news program via a complicated combination of carrier pigeons, smoke signals and morse code? Hint: it's the first one.\r\n\r\nPaly sophomores Zoe Limbrick, Maya Kandell and Esme Ablaza, along with the help of KZSU, Stanford's own radio channel, are working together to create Paly's very first audio publication.\r\n\r\nAccording to Limbrick, it was Kandell who first thought of the idea last semester while taking Beginning Journalism.\r\n\r\n\"The idea was brought up last semester sometime during Beginning Journalism, and then Maya [Kandell] contacted me shortly after to see if I was interested,\" Limbrick said.\r\n\r\nThe idea took off from there as the girls formed an official club with English teacher Lucy Fillipu as the advisor, as well as contacted KZSU.\r\n\r\n\"Six of us took a class to get air cleared at KZSU and they've been really supportive to help us get a show,\" Limbrick said.\r\n\r\nThe members of Radio Club have been working on straightening out the logistics of their new publication.\r\n\r\n\"We're going to loosely base our meetings off of a production cycle for a publication. We're going to work on story ideas and develop them during our meeting times,\" Limbrick said. \"Then we can conduct the actual interviews and do the initial editing outside of class. Our meetings will mostly be spent on creating the ideas and editing the stories.\"\r\n\r\nRadio Club's first broadcast was Sunday, April 13. Eventually, Limbrick and the others hope to have a fully-functioning publication to stand alongside the ranks of the rest of the Paly journalism program.\r\n\r\n\"We just want to produce a successful and professional show each week,\" Limbrick said.\r\n\r\nInterested in the club? Limbrick assures that it is not too late to sign up and participate.\r\n\r\n\"We're really welcoming for anyone who wants to join and you don't have to have any experience with radio or journalism,\" she said.","excerpt":"Paly sophomores Maya Kandell, Zoe Limbrick and Esme Ablaza, along with the help of KZSU, Stanford's own radio channel, are working together to create Paly's very first audio publication. \r\n","date":"2014-05-01 13:09:54","author":"Paige Esterly","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/Round-Radio.png","categories":["Features"],"tags":[]}]
