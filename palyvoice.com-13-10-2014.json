I am, personally, an avid fan of all boba drinks, having consumed over 80 of them since April.\r\n\r\nFirst things first, what is boba? Boba tea has many different names. Boba, PMT, pearl milk tea, bubble tea, tapioca milk tea or balls drink are all names that are frequently\u00a0used for this beverage. Boba and\u00a0PMT are the most commonly used, so I will be using that terminology for this blog.\r\n\r\nAccording to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sfgate.com\/food\/article\/Bubble-tea-The-fad-that-forgot-to-fade-5751614.php\">SFgate<\/a>, there are currently 75 PMT\u00a0shops in San Francisco, the East Bay and the Peninsula. For this first installment, I thought it would only be appropriate to review the most commonly visited places by Palo Alto High School students: the Castro Quadruplets. In downtown Mountain View, there are four stores that sell PMT, all within a three\u00a0block radius: Verde Tea Cafe, Tapioca Express, Tea Era Cafe and Jazen.\r\n\r\n<b>Verde Tea Cafe<\/b>\r\n\r\n<em>Overall rating: <\/em>8.5\/10\r\n\r\n<em>Student opinion:<\/em>\r\n\r\n\u201cI like their variety of drinks,\" freshman Leo Trejo said. \"They serve food as well, and the environment is comforting.\u201d\r\n\r\n<em> What I ordered:\u00a0<\/em>Coconut Pearl Milk Tea with extra pearls ($3.97)\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_75464\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_96032.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-75464\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_96032.jpg\" alt=\"The small size at Verde Tea Cafe is the larger size at most other PMT places. This is the only place that also features a &quot;tub&quot;. The pearls at Verde are also the largest to date.  \" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a> The small size at Verde Tea Cafe is the larger size at most other PMT places. This is the only place that also features a \"tub\". The pearls at Verde are also the largest to date. Photo by Alex Merkle-Raymond[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<em>Features:<\/em>\r\n\r\nVerde is one of the most commonly visited PMT places by Paly students. There is always a line, but the servers are very efficient and get even large orders done quickly. The small size, 22 ounces, at Verde is the larger size at most other PMT places, so it is the best bargain. They are also the only place with a \"tub,\" which is the largest size, 32 ounces, PMT available nearby.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons for this rating is because of the large variety of drinks Verde has available. Not only are\u00a0there around 30 milk tea flavors, but freeze blends and smoothies are also available. Pearls, jelly or bricks can be added to any order or not included at all, if that suits you. The pearls are large and chewy.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest issues I have with Verde is the inconsistency. Often, there is too much powder or too much sweetener, and other times, there is not enough, and it's like drinking a giant cup of milk. When Verde gets the proportions right, it's one of the best places available, but it can be risky.\r\n\r\nVerde also has meal options if the drink isn't filling enough for you, which range from chicken on a stick to cheesecake. Other upsides to Verde are its use of the super easy rewards system FIVESTARS and the availability of free WiFi.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Tapioca Express<\/b>\r\n\r\n<em>Overall rating: <\/em>5\/10\r\n\r\n<em>Student opinion:<\/em>\r\n\r\n\u201cI love the assortment,\" sophomore Victor Carlsson said. \"There are so many flavors to choose from. I really like the service and rewards program.\u201d\r\n\r\n<em>What I ordered:\u00a0<\/em>Coconut Milk Tea with extra pearls ($3.70)\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_75466\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9606.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-75466\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9606.jpg\" alt=\"Tapioca Express has very soft pearls and has the largest variety of flavors available.

The staff is very friendly and gives recommendations on the extensive menu. Photo by Alex Merkle-Raymond[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<em>Features:<\/em>\r\n\r\nThe staff at Tapioca Express is very friendly and patient. There are so many flavors \u2013 even to the point that it can almost be a little overwhelming. When looking at the menu, the cost of pearls is not already added into the price on the sign, so it can be difficult when budgeting.\r\n\r\nThe pearls are very large and soft, allowing them to easily get stuck in the straw, which makes it very difficult to drink. They are also overly sweet and difficult to chew. Additionally, the tea flavor is very pungent, almost to the point of bitterness.\r\n\r\nThere are meal options, but\u00a0I have never seen anyone order any food whenever I go there, which is a little unsettling. The rewards system at Tapioca Express is a little complicated. Large drinks and small drinks are stamped separately, and you can only redeem a free drink of the same size as the 10 drinks you've already bought.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Jazen Tea\u00a0<\/b><b>(Served at Pho Hoa)<\/b>\r\n\r\n<em>Overall rating:<\/em>\u00a06\/10\r\n\r\n<em>Student opinion:<\/em>\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fun place, and I like that they have both noodles and PMT available,\" senior Kelly Shi said. \"Their PMT is really good and their noodles have a really good flavor. I really like their pearls.\"\r\n\r\n<em>What I ordered:\u00a0<\/em>Jasmine Pearl Milk Tea ($3.55)\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_75465\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9633.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-75465\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9633.jpg\" alt=\"The three flavors offered at Jazen are all quite sweet.

Jazen is served at a Pho restaurant with a variety of other fruity beverages available. Photo by Alex Merkle-Raymond[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<em>Features:<\/em>\r\n\r\nJazen is part of a larger restaurant that serves pho and has smoothies and fruit drinks. The PMT offered only comes in three different flavors: Jasmine, Original and Apple Jack.\r\n\r\nJazen is one of the few places that uses syrup as a flavoring, and it's very obvious. There is often a ribbon of syrup along the inside the cup, which can make\u00a0the drink too sweet and causes the buyer to shake the drink around\u00a0to attain\u00a0a uniform sweetness.\r\n\r\nWhile Jazen specializes in adding fruit to the drinks, the pearls are still good: large and firm. The cups are larger and wider than at most PMT stores. They do not fit in the average cup holder or smaller hand.\r\n\r\nThe staff often waits for orders to build up before making them all, so it might take a while before the drinks are ready. Jazen uses a FIVESTARS \u00a0rewards system and also participates in various coupon sites.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Tea Era Cafe<\/b>\r\n\r\n<em>Overall rating:<\/em>\u00a07\/10\r\n\r\n<em>Student opinion:<\/em>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe service is kind of bad,\" freshman Hollie Chiao said. \"Some drinks I ordered were kind of sandy. Their coconut is not up to my standards, which are pretty high. It\u2019s too frothy.\"\r\n\r\n<em>What I ordered:\u00a0<\/em>Large Jasmine Pearl Milk Tea with extra pearls ($4.08)\r\n\r\n<em>Features:<\/em>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_75467\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9647.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-75467\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9647.jpg\" alt=\"Tea Era Cafe is very authentic.

Often the drinks have remnants of the powder flavor. The pearls are very small and firm and given generously. Photo by Alex Merkle-Raymond[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTea Era is a very small restaurant that is covered in handmade signs of drinks and rewards cards.\u00a0The menu is in Chinese and English and has some very unique flavors. Besides the usual honey, coconut and strawberry milk tea flavors, Tea Era has\u00a0Genmai brown rice, barley and mulberry to name a few.\r\n\r\nThe pearls are small and firm, making it very easy to drink many at a time. The powder never dissolves all the way into the drink and ends up coating the inside of the cup and the straw. Sometimes, there may even be a clump of powder that requires\u00a0vigorous shaking to break it up.\r\n\r\nEven though the tea might not be a very smooth texture, it does have lots of flavor and is rarely too sweet. The granule texture is a trademark of Tea Era that you quickly get used to and come to enjoy. I have gone many times and they have never messed up my order, which cannot be said of many other PMT places.\r\n\r\nThere can be a long line, and the service is not very fast for the large amount of staffers there. The rewards card is a stamp system. After buying 10 drinks, the next drink is free as long as there are no additions.","excerpt":"Each week, staff writer Alex Merkle-Raymond will take on the Pearl Milk Tea world, one cup at a time.

This included first and second place in both categories of Lighting and Sound. In addition, two students won statewide scholarships.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s exceptional,\u201d Woods said. \u201cThat\u2019s really, really unusual for any one school to have that much.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith talented resources in the department, Woods is looking forward to the year ahead with regards to ComedySportz.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery ComedySportz event that I\u2019ve attended \u2026 is just very clever and sharp and quick,\" Woods said. \"It\u2019s just a lot of fun to watch as an audience member, and it\u2019s really rewarding for the students participating in the improv.\u00a0I\u2019m really looking forward to the added element of having ComedySportz.\u201d","excerpt":"For the first year ever, the Palo Alto High School Theatre Department will partake in competitive improvisation as part of its newly-created ComedySportz team.","date":"2014-10-10 13:30:11","author":"Samuel Desr\u00e9","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_8527.jpg","categories":["Entertainment"],"tags":{"29694":"chris hinstorff","29692":"comedy sports","29691":"comedysportz","29693":"improv","29689":"kathleen woods","9159":"theater","9160":"theatre","29695":"thespian","29690":"zoe limbrick"}},{"id":75828,"title":"Highlights from Sen.

As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I'm here to tell you that I will not let that happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make no mistake, America's intelligence [agencies] are made up of thousands of overwhelmingly dedicated men and women who make enormous sacrifices to protect this nation. No one that I know in the senate or at this table wants to deprive our intelligence agencies of the tools that will actually make the world safer. But it's now clear that dragnet surveillance conflicts with core American values and doesn't make us\u00a0safer.\r\n\r\n\"The government ought to stop requiring American companies to participate in this suspicion-less collection of customers data and begin the process of rebuilding trust at home.\"\r\n\r\n<b><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Microsoft Brad Smith<\/span><\/b>\r\n\r\n\"Just as people would not put their money in a bank they don't trust, they will be reluctant to put their information in a data center or in a phone they don't trust.\"\r\n\r\n\"When trust is shattered, it needs to be rebuilt.\"\r\n\r\n\"[We need]\u00a0to go back to the fundamental personal rights that are at stake.

We don't want the NSA and other people in it.'\u00a0The cost of that is huge, in terms of knowledge, discovery, science, growth and jobs.\"\r\n\r\n<strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #000000;\">General Counsel of Facebook Colin Stretch<\/span><\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"One of the biggest challenges we're confronting as an industry is the inability for most of the world's population to access the Internet. ... Eighty percent\u00a0of the people without Internet access around the world are within range of a cell tower. The reason they do not have Internet access is because it costs too much. One of the big challenges for us as an industry is to bring technology to\u00a0address that problem, to get the rest of the world. Data localization takes us in exactly the wrong direction, simply because it costs too much money.\"\r\n\r\n\"From our perspective, the most profoundly disturbing [disclosures] was ... hacking, the sort of things we do see from some other countries that are involved with state-sponsored espionage. That put the relationship between the\u00a0industry and the U.S. government on a slightly different footing. ... What those disclosures\u00a0[hacking]\u00a0brought to light was there was this effort outside of what we all thought of as the appropriate legal process to attain user data. ... It placed renewed focus on our need to protect ourselves from these\u00a0sorts of unauthorized overseas attacks.\"\r\n\r\n<strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #000000;\">General Counsel of Dropbox Ramsey Homsany<\/span><\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"We need to be committed to providing good security and encryption for our users.\"\r\n\r\n\"Encryption is a critically important technology for everything we do and everything that happens on the Internet. Why would we start to hamper with it ... rather than wanting to develop great encryption and apply it so that consumers can have a lot of trust and faith in the fact that what they do store online is safe? There are many other ways for the government to get data when they're doing investigations ... which has been the legal norm for hundreds of years.\"\r\n\r\n<strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Partner of Greylock Partners John Lilly<\/span><\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"Most people want to follow the law.\u00a0Most people want to stay safe\u00a0... but [there's] this\u00a0bifurcation of citizenry and law enforcement and government, and we're getting a drumbeat of that, and that's increasingly the society we do not want.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"At a Senate Finance Committee Chairman's roundtable held yesterday in the Paly Big Gym, United States Sen.

Photo by Lily Zhang.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nMaking Olympic history for the United States is not something a typical 18-year-old can check off her bucket list.\r\n\r\nNeither is being named \"Athlete of the Month\" for a sport by Team USA.\r\n\r\nRecent Palo Alto High School alumna Lily Zhang has accomplished both of these things and more. Not only is she the first (and only) American to have competed at the Olympic Games prior to the Youth Olympic Games, but Zhang is also the first to win a table tennis medal at the Olympic level for the U.S. She secured a bronze medal in women\u2019s singles table tennis last month at the Youth Olympics in Nanjing, China. After a victorious trip overseas, Zhang returned to the Bay Area to pursue her college education at University of California, Berkeley.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice caught up with Zhang to learn more about her experiences as a professional athlete.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Paly Voice:<\/strong> When\u00a0and why did you start playing table tennis?\r\n\r\n<strong>Lily Zhang:<\/strong> I started playing at the age of seven when my friend took me to the Palo Alto Table Tennis Club.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> What has been your favorite part about playing?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> There's so much that drew me to table tennis. I love the rapidity of the game, the vast amount of different strategies and styles, the mental aspect of the sport and I especially love traveling for tournaments and learning about the various cultures of the world.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> What are your hopes or expectations of the table tennis program at UC Berkeley?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> I know that UC Berkeley has one of the best table tennis teams in the nation and I already know many of the players on the team, so I'm extremely excited to join the team. I also hope to help the team win gold at the College Nationals next semester.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> How do you think the demands of a college student will affect your training?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> It's definitely much harder to practice here because of the demands of college, but I'm going to try to push myself to practice as much as I can on the weekends, as well as go home to my club on some weekends to practice.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> How has your experience at the Youth Olympic Games helped you as a professional athlete?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> Participating in the Youth Olympic Games has given me so much experience I can take with me to future tournaments or events. I think my mental game improved significantly after the Games, as I was able to calm myself down and breathe deeply whenever I got too nervous there.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> What\u2019s the most helpful advice your coach or anyone has ever given you?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> l think the most helpful advice I received was from my parents. Unlike many other parents in this sport, my parents never, ever pushed me to play table tennis and always gave me the choice to pursue what I wanted. In doing so, they helped me realize that I play because I truly love the sport, not because I was pushed or forced to.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> Do you have any advice for current Paly athletes?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> I guess my advice to current Paly athletes would be something along the same lines: Pursue something you're really passionate about\u00a0because you will work hard to achieve your goals, but at the same time, really enjoy doing it.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> What are the next steps in your table tennis career?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> I'm still trying to work it out with my professors, but I'm hoping to attend the 2014 World Junior Championships in Shanghai, China. It'll be my seventh time playing World Juniors, and my goal is to win the first ever medal for the U.S. there.","excerpt":"Making Olympic history for the United States is not something a typical 18-year-old can check off his or her bucket list.

Palo Alto High School students are welcome and are encouraged to participate at the event.\r\n\r\nChefs from popular Bay Area restaurants are running workshops so that students can learn more about food in a qualitative way, according to Tasting Week event organizers. Some of the PAUSD schools participating will be Escondido Elementary School and Barron Park Elementary School, according to the Tasting Week Calendar on the website.\r\n\r\nOn a press release on Monday, PAUSD Communications Coordinator Tabitha Kappeler-Hurley wrote that some of the chefs leading the workshops include c<span style=\"color: #222222;\">hef Charlie Ayers from Calafia in Palo Alto, chef Marco Fossati from Four Seasons in Palo Alto and chef Nathan Beriau from Ritz Carlton in San Francisco.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe top chefs are visiting local schools to blossom students\u2019 love for food, share new tastes and aromas, as well as teach students alternatives to unhealthy food options, according to Kappeler-Hurley.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe idea to have Bay Area schools launch this celebration of food came from a group of Bay Area parents who believe that educating children about taste is the best way to get them to love food and, at the same time, to fight obesity,\u201d\u00a0Kappeler-Hurley wrote.\r\n\r\nAfter its launch in Palo Alto four years ago, Tasting Week has\u00a0now expanded to schools across the bay in cities such as San Francisco and Berkeley. The founder of the organization of the Bay Area Tasting Week organization is Rebecca Scholl-Barbier, a Palo Alto parent with four children in the PAUSD.\r\n\r\nSome students see the benefits of the event and are eager to sample and learn about the different tastes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d want to go to a workshop,\u201d Walter Hays Elementary fifth grader Hana Krieger said. \u201cI think it [Tasting Week] is good because it gives students a chance to try things for free.\u201d\r\n\r\nOthers understand the goal of Tasting Week, and see how it can educate people.\r\n\r\n\u201cA lot of people who don\u2019t know how to cook would want to go to the event,\" junior Isabelle Vincent said. \"People who don\u2019t really know what goes in their food can develop healthier eating habits [at the workshops]. It\u2019s always good to know how to cook at least one thing. I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to go [to a workshop] but if I knew it was happening and I was free I\u2019d go.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor those who are interested in participating in this event, the Tasting Week schedule for schools in the PAUSD can be found on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tastingweek.com\/calendar\/tasting-week-school-schedule-2014\/\">official website<\/a>.","excerpt":"Tasting Week, a food event led by professional chefs, offers students in the Palo Alto Unified School District a chance to participate in various food-related workshops.","date":"2014-10-09 15:09:11","author":"Ana Caklovic","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/photo-1.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8512":"Bay Area","29863":"chef","29864":"elementary school","8713":"Food","8751":"gunn","29867":"health","29866":"obesity","29862":"tasting week","29865":"walter hays"}}]
