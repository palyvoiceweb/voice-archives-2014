Photo by Paige Esterly.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIf you run into your English teacher in your math class, no, it's not because Ms. X wants to brush up her algebra skills. In an effort to open up communication between students and teachers, School Climate Committee head Eric Bloom is working to assign teachers different students to shadow for an average school day, an effort that will continue throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bloom, Principal Kim Diorio originally encouraged departmental Instructional Supervisors, as well as Western Association of Schools and Colleges focus group leaders, to participate in the shadowing program. However, once the idea was pitched, other teachers came to Bloom expressing interest as well.\r\n\r\nBloom's job here is to pair teachers and students. Once a teacher comes to Bloom, he or she may request a grade level to shadow. From there, Bloom finds an appropriate student for the specific teacher, striving to find a range of course loads and extra curricular activities.\r\n\r\n\"What we're really trying to get them to do is follow a real schedule,\" Bloom said.\r\n\r\nBloom believes that by shadowing students, teachers will gain insight into the lives of high schoolers, a sentiment echoed by World History teacher and history department IS, Jacyln Edwards.\r\n\r\nEdwards, who teaches freshmen, believes that her experience shadowing a student will directly impact her future teaching decisions.\r\n\r\n\"I already altered one of my assignments because I was a freshman so I followed a freshman schedule,\" she said. \"Many of the students I have I was also in their classes and I came to realize that they had some other things that were due this week. We all know that, but we never really know what and we don't know when, we just know that it happens. I just saw that the students had quite a bit due this week so I changed my assignment, simple as that.\"\r\n\r\nAfter realizing exactly how heavy her students' course-loads are, Edwards plans to use her new-found knowledge to change her teaching policies as a whole.\r\n\r\n\"[After this experience I will] maybe be more forthcoming, like, you know, hey if you have three tests on a Monday and I am one of those teachers giving you a test, come talk to me and we'll figure out another time,\" she said.\r\n\r\nIn the future, in addition to continuing on with teachers following students, Bloom hopes to experiment with both parents and students following teachers to further increase communication.\r\n\r\nEdwards says she believes that this idea, if correctly executed, would be beneficial.\r\n\r\n\"I think it [students following teachers] is a good idea,\" Edwards said. \"The good thing about a teacher following a student or vice-versa is it really opens up communication.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"In an effort to open up communication between students and teachers, School Climate Committee head Eric Bloom is working to assign teachers different students to shadow for an average school day, an effort that will continue throughout the semester.","date":"2014-04-22 13:27:58","author":"Paige Esterly","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/paige.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"11236":"eric bloom","14294":"Jacyln Edwards","14295":"shadowing","14296":"teacher shadowing"}},{"id":70850,"title":"Boys\u2019 golf roars off to 11-0 start, faces second-place Gunn today","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/22\/boys-golf-roars-off-to-11-0-start-faces-second-place-gunn-today\/","content":"Head over to the Palo Alto Municipal Golf Course on a weekday afternoon and you will see some of the best high school golfers in the city working on their drives and perfecting their putts. Today, these boys will face off against each other representing their respective schools, as the Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 golf team (11-0) takes on its crosstown rival Gunn High School (10-1) in San Jose.\r\n\r\nPracticing on the same course and living in the same community as the Gunn players, the Paly team sees the matchup as not just a battle for first place in league, but for bragging rights: the Paly boys have earned an undefeated record, winning all 10 of their matches thus far, while the Gunn golfers\u2019 only loss came on March 25 when they fell to the Vikings, 187-179.\r\n\r\nPaly junior John Knowles acknowledged the heightened level of personal pride involved in competing against the team\u2019s crosstown rival.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe upcoming Gunn match doesn\u2019t have any significant playoff importance, but it\u2019s more of a pride thing, as we practice at the same place as the Gunn team,\u201d Knowles said. \u201cIn addition, it is always nice to finish undefeated and so that will be an added motivation.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of Paly\u2019s major strengths lies in its depth, sophomore Henry Gordon said.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have a very deep team,\u00a0so if our top players struggle one day, our lower ranked players can still contend with other top players from other teams,\u201d Gordon said.\r\n\r\nKnowles agreed that the team\u2019s overall talent gives it an edge over its opponent.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have 10 solid guys who have the ability to play very well,\u201d Knowles said. \u201cIn the matches, we all have a shot to win medalist or get the low score, so I think we are driven to not only beat the other team, but beat the guys on our team as well.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile their sheer talent is undeniable, a secret to the Vikings\u2019 success may lie in their team chemistry, according to Knowles.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs far as I know, everyone on the team likes everyone else, and I personally enjoy spending time with the team,\u201d Knowles said. \u201cI'm not sure how much this contributes to our success, but it makes matches more enjoyable when you like spending time with the teammate you're playing with.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings also rely on their teammates to push each other and keep each other focused and motivated, according to Paly junior Alex Hwang.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think having some sort of competition for playing the top spots on the team motivates us to give more effort, especially in matches that we may beat the opponent by a large margin in,\u201d Hwang said. \u201cTo some extent, there's more competition between members of our team to post a low score than with the other team.\u201d\r\n\r\nMost recently, the Vikings defeated the Homestead Mustangs, 218-195, yesterday to improve to an 11-0 record. Paly plans to maintain its perfect record by bringing its competitive attitude into the rematch with Gunn this afternoon.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we're all confident in our ability to beat Gunn,\u201d Hwang said. \u201cHaving confidence in the others members of the team plays a big role in our individual confidence and not making us too nervous.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings tee off against the Titans at 3 p.m. today at the Santa Teresa Golf Club in San Jose.\r\n\r\n<em><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/author\/jaschwartz14\/\">Jared Schwartz<\/a> contributed to this story.<\/em>","excerpt":"After earning an undefeated record going into the end of the regular season, the Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 golf team (10-0) is preparing to take on cross-town rival Gunn High School (10-1) Tuesday at the Santa Teresa Golf Club.","date":"2014-04-22 12:48:49","author":"Allison Cowie","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/golfclubs2.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"14524":"alex hwang","14522":"gunn golf","14525":"henry gordon","14526":"john knowles","14523":"palo alto high school boys golf","14521":"paly golf"}},{"id":70831,"title":"Paly theater students to showcase original plays tonight","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/21\/paly-theater-students-to-showcase-original-plays-tonight\/","content":"Eight Palo Alto High School theater students will be presenting their original 10-minute plays at 7 p.m.\u00a0tonight at the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts.\r\n\r\nAfter two months of workshopping with their peers, the eight students will get a chance to showcase their work in collaboration with professional actors and directors.\r\n\r\n\"Every playwright gets an hour and a half to work with the directors and the actors,\" junior playwright Molly Mackris said. \"We get to workshop the script with the actors and make final adjustments and at the end we get to present it.\"\r\n\r\nMackris has really enjoyed the process of workshopping her play with her peers.\r\n\r\n\"It\u2019s been a lot of fun so far,\" Mackris said. \"I love playwriting and working with other people who have opinion and its been really benefical.\"\r\n\r\nSophomore playwright Clara Baker also agrees with Mackris on the workshopping process.\r\n\r\n\"I love writing,\" Baker said. \"It was a fun process having people read through my play and giving it detailed feedback.\"\r\n\r\nBaker also thinks highly of the event as a way for Paly students to show their artistic talents.\r\n\r\n\"Just because we\u2019re young and still in school doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t create art that is comparable to the creations of artists that work in the professional world, and this is tangible evidence of that,\" Baker said.\r\n\r\nMackris strongly encourages Paly students to attend to the unique event for a variety of reasons.\r\n\r\n\"Admission is free,\" Mackris said. \"All the plays are really interesting and they've come a long way since the beginning.

As a junior, this was my first year at Prom, and I have to say, although it was fun, it did not quite live up to all the hype of being \"sold-out\" and the $300+ price tag (once all expenses were accounted for).\r\n\r\nHere's my take on my \"Night at the museum\":\r\n\r\n<strong>Transportation: 5\/10<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe bus loading itself was smooth. No complaints there. Maybe it was just me, but our bus was situated directly in the sun, and waiting for 20 minutes in the Paly parking lot was not fun. The ride to the city was fast. Probably unexpectedly fast because we arrived at the Exploratorium at 7:10 p.m. Great! An extra 50 minutes of Prom, right? Nope, we circled through the surrounding neighborhood for almost an hour because we were not allowed to enter the museum early. As conversation topics were quickly depleted, more students turned to their phones for entertainment and the buzz of excitement lessened. Not quite the beginning to Prom I expected.\r\n\r\n<strong>Venue: 9\/10<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI have to say, overall, the Exploratorium was an excellent choice. It provided activities for that awkward time before people started dancing and for those who preferred not to dance. Activities included magnets to play with, shadow pictures, a distorted mirror and even balancing a rod with a changing center of gravity, which seemed identical to a lab I did in physics class. Leave it to Paly to make Prom educational, am I right? My only complaint was that although the venue was large, a long hallway full of exhibits and tables led to an atrium, the dance floor itself was small and ran into tables and activities. The patio outside, however, spanned practically the length of the whole museum and provided fresh air and a break from the noise.\r\n\r\n<strong>Food: 4\/10<\/strong>\r\n\r\nDespite the promising start of kettle chips and a wide variety of beverages, the food was definitely a low point of Prom. I'm sorry, but falafel burgers topped with cucumbers and five types of weird cold noodles are not Prom food. I'm pretty sure mini pizzas or even plain bread would have been more popular among students. Maybe I missed something, but besides the wide variety of desserts which I did not have, there was not much choice in foods. Although the root beer floats and mac-and-cheese were good, my friends and I went home very hungry. In my opinion, $100+ tickets should have paid for a filling meal.\r\n\r\n<strong>Music: 7\/10<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe D.J. did a good job of building excitement and making the dance lively and fun, but some of the song choices were interesting to say the least. Despite the D.J.'s disclaimer that he tried to accommodate all requests and that all the songs he played were songs that someone actually wanted, he mixed it up a little too much and veered away from good dancing songs. For example, although country music may be great for square dancing, it is not good Prom music. I did think the D.J. played the right amount of slow music and picked good songs for those dances. Finally, props to the D.J. for ending with \"Let it Go\" from everyone's favorite movie.\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall Enjoyment: 7\/10<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI definitely had a great time. Prom is the best Paly event I have been to, and the positive aspects of the event by far outweighed any negative ones. My biggest regret was not bringing extra shoes. I know. I thought I could pull off four hours in heels, but it is harder than it looks. Although the night itself will slip farther into the past, I will remember it fondly or at least be reminded of it by those who only change their Facebook profile pictures once a year, conveniently on the day after prom.\r\n\r\n[poll id=\"3\"]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Each year, about half of Palo Alto High School students travel to a four-hour event, which we all know and love as Prom.

Each day will also be associated with a certain color that the students will be encouraged to wear, according to Hall. The different colors for the days are red, blue, purple, green and rainbow.\r\n\r\nEach day will consist of different activities, including performances and various people coming to talk about the issues being addressed.\u00a0For example, on ability awareness day on Wednesday, Best Buddies is coming to do an activity with the student body. Ada's Cafe, a local business that employs people who are both abled and disabled,\u00a0will be catering on the Quad on that day, too. On the last day, since the color is rainbow, the committee of students running NIOS will be giving shirts to students who will have the opportunity to tie dye them, according to Hall.\r\n\r\n\"This year [we want] to help spark talk about diversity,\" Multicultural Commissioner Ellen Shuan said.\u00a0\"We want to focus on different themes each day\u00a0so we can\u00a0address everything about equality and diversity.\"\r\n\r\nThursday, compassion and action day, is also when the Paly service day is taking place.

After that, you are placed in a direct elimination bracket just like March Madness where you get a seed and need to win to move on. \u00a0In the DE [direct elimination] you fence to 15 touches.\r\nCollege is different, because there are no 15 point bouts. At each tournament, you fence multiple schools and you fence three to five opponents from each school.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:\u00a0<\/strong>Do you have any advice for current Paly or high school athletes?\r\n<strong>NB:\u00a0<\/strong>Make sure that you are doing a sport that you love. When I was growing up, a stick was always a sword to me, and I think that is one of the main reasons I have done so well in my fencing career. Just as with anything else in life, if you are not fully committed to your sport, you are never going to reach your full potential.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_70674\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"458\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/IMG_40581.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-70674\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/IMG_40581.jpg\" alt=\"Noah Berman won a duel against an opponent from Duke University.

The team performed particularly well\u00a0in the areas of chemistry, physics and biology, according to Lin.\r\n\r\n\"We won in Materials Science [a chemistry\/physics lab event], Technical Problem Solving [a chemistry\/physics lab event], Entomology [biological identification event], and Anatomy and Physiology [a biological study event],\" Lin said. \"One of the most satisfying moments was our Mission Possible, a really difficult [and] fickle Rube Goldberg device, placing second after many hours of perfecting all of the energy transitions.\"\r\n\r\nEven though Paly performed very well to earn its second-place finish, Lin says the team is ready for a rematch with rival Mira Loma High School, which took first place. Before the 2013 competition which the Vikings\u00a0won, the Mira Loma Matadors had immense success, winning the state championship in each of their previous eight seasons.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_70697\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/10167963_10202794237192063_1114331910087502015_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-70697\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/10167963_10202794237192063_1114331910087502015_n.jpg\" alt=\"Seniors Annie Chen and Grace Lin pose with sophomores Sylvia Targ and Ivy Li before driving to Prom in San Francisco straight from the Northern California Science Olympiad competition in Turlock.
