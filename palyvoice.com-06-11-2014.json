It is very intuitive to play as well. Just pick a category like \"Animals Gone Wild\" or \"Superstars\" and start guessing. \"Heads Up!\" requires at least two players, but can include as may people as you want. One player is the designated guesser and places the mobile device on their forehead. The other players act out or describe the word displayed. Tilt up for correct answers and tilt down to pass. At the end of the minute, the app shows which words the person got right and wrong. During the game, \"Heads Up!\" uses the front-facing camera to record the round, and at the end,\u00a0 you can replay it for laughs.\r\n\r\n\"Heads Up!\" also offers extra category decks for 99 cents such as \"Movie Buff\" and \"Superheroes.\" I bought one extra deck \"Wish You Were Here\" that had famous cities and locations. Although it was fun, I'm not sure it was worth the money. The included decks are more than enough for hours of entertainment.\r\n\r\nMy personal favorite deck is \"Act It Out\" where you are only allowed to use gestures to describe the words. It is always super funny to watch and fun to act out.\r\n\r\nI rate it two thumbs and one \"Heads Up!\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Here is the third installment of APPetite featuring Heads Up!

The parade was held in honor of the season and the Giants' third World Series championship in five years. Although it was raining at the parade, no spirits were dampened. \"The parade was so fun despite the rain,\" Palo Alto High School senior Priscilla Bell said. Photo by Priscilla Bell.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPalo Alto High School students express their excitement for the\u00a0San Francisco Giants' third World Series win in five years by attending the\u00a0rain-soaked streets of San Francisco for a parade on Friday.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was just magical the way everything came together to get them into the World Series,\u201d said junior Nikhil Rajaram, who was not able to attend the parade. \u201cIt's just great to be able to grow up in a time where we have as great a local baseball team as we do.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe parade that began on Market Street and ended at the Civic Center celebrated the Giants' season and their championship. In the victory game on Thursday, which was led by the pitcher and World Series Most Valuable Player Madison Bumgarner, the Giants took Game seven of the 2014 World Series on the road against the Kansas City Royals by a score of 3-2.\r\n\r\nThe Giants now have established what many consider a dynasty: three World Series wins in five seasons: 2010, 2012 and 2014. Although he did not attend the parade, senior Galen Byrd is excited about the\u00a0Giants being able to win so many World Series championships in such a small period of time.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is just exciting to be watching history unfold in front of our eyes,\u201d Byrd said. \u201cI think a lot of kids don't understand how rare it is to win a championship in any major league sport, so to have won three\u00a0in five\u00a0years is just crazy.\u201d\r\n\r\nSenior Priscilla Bell, a passionate Giants fan, attended the rainy and confetti-filled parade in 2010, 2012 and 2014.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were so many people, and we all kept cheering,\u201d Bell said. \u201cAll the players were on top of double-decked buses and waving.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite the rain, Bell managed to have a great time.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt [the parade] was just about embracing being there and [being] around everyone else who is a massive Giants fan, and [I was] so happy to be there,\u201d Bell said.\r\n\r\nThe parade celebrated the legendary game\u00a0that had\u00a0Tim Hudson as the starting pitcher, the oldest pitcher ever to start a Game seven in the World Series. He ran into trouble in the second inning after an RBI [runs batted in] double and a sacrifice fly. This forced manager Bruce Bochy to bring in left-handed reliever Jeremy Affeldt to take his place. Affeldt responded by pitching 2.1 scoreless innings of relief, setting the stage for Bumgarner in the fifth\u00a0inning with the Giants leading 3-2.\r\n\r\nBumgarner was named the MVP of the series after setting an Major League Baseball record for most innings pitched in a single postseason. His relief appearance in Game seven, five shutout innings, came just three days after he threw 117 pitches while throwing a complete-game shutout in Game 5 on Sunday.\r\n\r\n\u201cI've been a Giants fan since I can remember, and it's always nice to see a Bay Area team win something so amazing,\u201d junior Maddy Atwater said.","excerpt":"Many San Francisco Giants fans from Palo Alto lined up on the rain-soaked streets of San Francisco on Friday to celebrate the San Francisco Giants' third win in the World Series in five years.","date":"2014-11-02 20:39:23","author":"Adele Bloch","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Screen-Shot-2014-11-02-at-11.16.47-AM.png","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"31867":"buster posey","31864":"civic center","8732":"giants","31866":"kansas city royals","31865":"market street","9655":"San Francisco Giants","31868":"santiago casilla","9239":"world series"}},{"id":77397,"title":"Spirit Week Final Results","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/11\/02\/spirit-week-final-results\/","content":"The seniors won both the Spirit Dance and best float on Day Five of Spirit Week, which allowed them to beat the juniors.
