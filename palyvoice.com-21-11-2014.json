The menu offers acai, pitaya (dragon fruit) and kale bowls, oatmeal and smoothies.

Bare Bowls requests that all customers tell them their food preferences before ordering in order to make sure the food is as satisfactory as possible. All the granola is gluten-free. The back wall of the restaurant has a message board where community members\u00a0can\u00a0advertise for activities around the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nSome\u00a0Palo Alto High School students find acai bowls a delicious snack and the experience enjoyable. Additionally, students appreciate what Bare Bowls has to offer over other acai bowls they have tried.\r\n\r\n\"Normally, acai bowls are too sweet, but Bare's isn't, so you can actually taste the small nuances they put in the toppings like agave nectar,\" senior Alexandra Hsieh said. \"I didn't stay for long, but the ambience was really nice.\"\r\n\r\nAs with many other\u00a0specialty restaurant for healthy foods, Bare Bowls is expensive. The small bowl is $8 and the regular bowl is $12, which may be out of many students\u2019 budgets, according to junior Molly Kraus.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt [Bare Bowls] tastes like overpriced Jamba Juice in a bowl,\u201d Kraus said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_78852\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"350\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/unnamed-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-78852\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/unnamed-1.jpg\" alt=\"Senior Oskar Soderberg and junior Molly Kraus play checkers at Bare Bowls.
