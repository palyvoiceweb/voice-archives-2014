President Snow tortures him until he voices anti-rebellion sentiments to all of Panem.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe storyline revolves around Katniss in the forgotten-yet-rebellious District 13, as she makes trips to other districts to create propaganda videos as the mockingjay. Her role as the mockingjay is to be the face of the rebellion against the capitol during the revolution. Reunited with her childhood friend Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), Katniss is reluctant to make any commitments to him because she is conflicted about her feelings for Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), her star-crossed lover and male District 12 tribute. Before the Hunger Games, a happy life with Gale was what Katniss always wanted, yet now she questions whether she really loves Peeta as he undergoes a transformation into President Snow's (Donald Sutherland) puppet.\r\n\r\nLawrence's emotional performance accurately portrays the traumatized Katniss and her reactions as they were in the books the \"Hunger Games\" movies are based on. Other characters also remain true to their developments in\u00a0\"Mockingjay\" by Suzanne Collins. Such as in the case of Gale, where more of his relationship with Katniss is highlighted, and of Finnick Odair (Sam Clafin), who has the largest transformation: swaying far from his over-confident and womanizing ways in the capital as observed in \"Catching Fire,\" to living a depressing life in District 13.\r\n\r\nHaymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson)\u00a0and Effie \u00a0Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) remain a dynamic duo, bringing laughs to the rather somber and violent plot. We see Haymitch\u00a0in complete withdrawal due to President Coin's (Julianne Moore) prohibition laws in District 13. Katniss's escort Effie loses some of her sparkle in her institutionalized military attire, yet remains her quirky self at heart. Without her elaborate makeup, wigs or highfalutin lifestyle, she makes the best of accessorizing what she does have.\r\n\r\nMoving away from the arena setting in which the first two movies in the series take place, the storyline unveils new sides of the story's protagonists as the uprising takes off. Exploring the revolts within the districts puts faces to the uprising's cause and casualties, which connects the audience to each character\u00a0and allows us to understand Panem, the futuristic, dystopian\u00a0world\u00a0of the novels, better.\r\n\r\n\"Mockingjay\" captures the spirit of the beginning of an uprising\u00a0by\u00a0offering a more somber tone. The film's mood is particularly captured in the haunting ballad, \"The Hanging Tree,\" sung by Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, which echoes the sadness of the loss of so many of Panem. These emotional moments tug at the audience's heartstrings, but the mood is often lightened by comedic breaks from fan-favorite characters Haymitch and\u00a0Effie.\r\n\r\nThe choice to split the book into two movies pays off as audiences are able to get an in-depth look into Panem's districts and the supporting characters, which can be particularly appreciated by fans of the series. Some characters such as Gale, who were hardly developed in previous films, are able to show more layers of their personalities and win over the audience's hearts.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_79224\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"206\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Effie-Stylin-in-13.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-79224\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Effie-Stylin-in-13.jpg\" alt=\"Effie (Elizabeth Banks), Katniss' escort from the capitol, goes through a makeup and wig withdrawal while living in militaristic District 13.

The lavish Capitol parties, clothing and food are replaced by drab military barracks, gray jumpsuits and cafeteria rations.\r\n\r\nThough the ending does seem slightly abrupt, we left with an overall excitement to await the final installment in the Hunger Games series as \"Mockingjay\u2013 Part 2\" is scheduled to be released on Nov. 20, 2015.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1<\/strong><\/em>\r\n\r\n<em><strong>123 minutes<\/strong><\/em> <em><strong>Release Date: Nov. 21, 2014<\/strong><\/em>\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Rated: PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, some disturbing images and thematic material <\/strong><\/em>\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Directed by Francis Lawrence <\/strong><\/em>\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Starring: Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson, Phillip Seymour-Hoffman and Elizabeth Banks <\/strong><\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The third installment in the captivating worldwide franchise The Hunger Games, \"Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1\" closely follows the book's plot that it is adapted from as it picks up where \"Catching Fire\" left off, following the traumatized Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) as she becomes the rebel's symbol: the mockingjay.

Kellerman added that the library will also be getting a charging station for phones and more comfortable chairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll of this furniture will be able to move into the new library once it is remodeled,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cThe library remodel will be begin once the gym complex is finished.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the furniture is coming in during the school week, library computers will be unavailable this coming Monday and Tuesday, according to Kellerman. The library will have a computer cart instead, and students can use Computer Lab 1 and 2 to print.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Monday and Tuesday before a holiday tend to have fewer students at school, so we thought this would be a good time to install the new furniture before the rush of final projects and finals are upon us,\u201d Kellerman said.\r\n\r\nThe new furniture in the library is part of the school\u2019s gradual shift towards more collaborative, ergonomic furniture. The English Department will also receive new furniture soon, according to English Instructional Supervisor Shirley Tokheim.\r\n\r\n\u201cA generous donor has purchased all new modern furniture for every English Department classroom,\u201d Tokheim said. \u201cThe new furniture will support the collaborative nature of our teaching, so forming groups with other students will be easier and more efficient.\u201d\r\n\r\nSenior Carol Hung said she thinks the new furniture may make the library more of a hub for students.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think the MAC is a lot more inviting [due to the new furniture],\u201d Hung said. \u201cSo if the library gets the newer furniture, people may be more motivated to go the library and study.\u201d","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School library will receive new furniture this Monday and Tuesday, inhibiting students' access to computers for those two days.","date":"2014-11-23 16:44:52","author":"Julia Asin","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/library-furniture-featured-image.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"33413":"carol hung","8616":"construction","11645":"english department","11130":"furniture","8847":"librarian","8848":"Library","18366":"mac","33411":"new furniture","9025":"rachel kellerman","33412":"shirley tokheim"}}]
