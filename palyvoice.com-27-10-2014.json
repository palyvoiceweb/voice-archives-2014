If you need some inspiration for outfits, check out these suggestions\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/23\/must-have-spirit-week-outfits\/\">here<\/a>. The senior theme is \"Great Gatsby,\" but seniors\u00a0will be donning their customary '90s attire. Juniors will be dressing as \"Pirates\" based off of their class color yellow. The sophomores will sport athletic attire based off their theme \"Red Card.\" The freshman theme is \"The Lion King,\" but their outfits may also include any other Disney character.\r\n\r\nMonday's rally will be held on the football field at lunch. According to Student Activities Director Matt Hall, there will be three Minute to Win It games, where contestants have one minute to complete the given task. The two new games are \"Shake it\" and \"Nose Dive,\" and the one returning game from last year's Spirit Week is \"Banana Bump.\"\r\n\r\n\"After a wild and crazy introduction last year, we decided to keep it ['Banana Bump'],\" Hall said. \"It got approved, so we're going to do it, and that will be fun.\"\r\n\r\nTo play \"Shake it,\" one representative from each class will have one pedometer strapped to a leg and arm each. Participants then will move around for one minute, and those with the highest number of \"steps\" at the end wins. \"Nose Dive\" also requires one participant from each grade.\u00a0The task for \"Nose Dive\" is to transfer the greatest number of cotton balls from one bowl to another using just petroleum jelly on the contestant's noses. The returning game from last year, \"Banana Bump,\" requires one participant from each class to attach a banana to their waist by string and push an orange on the ground to the finish line.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_77053\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"275\"]<img class=\"wp-image-77053\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_6292.jpg\" alt=\"Freshmen dress according to their theme &quot;Warning\/Under Construction&quot; during Spirit Week 2013.

After over a year of collaboration, teachers had a final opportunity to provide their opinion on the goals during the Staff Development Day on October 10th, according to Garrison.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe more people you have involved in the process the better,\u201d Garrison said. \"You can network, you can come together, especially in a unified district.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly senior and WASC Student Leader Arin Tai-Seale thinks student involvement in WASC is an advantage.\r\n\r\n\"Any time during the WASC process comments and questions are welcome from anyone. So students can have a large impact on the process if we choose to,\" Tai-Seale said.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a retreat for student leaders and other members of WASC held in the English Resource Center, WASC members voted to select the three goals, according to Tai-Seale.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_76852\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/photo-21.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-76852\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/photo-21.jpg\" alt=\"Posters like this &quot;Stress Tree&quot; were used to break down the problems students face at Paly and isolate weaknesses.\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" \/><\/a> Posters like this \"Stress Tree\" were used to break down the problems students face \u00a0and determine\u00a0weaknesses at Paly.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\"It was a very open process, however there were not very many students involved in the retreat ... about five students were present during the retreat at different time intervals,\" Tai-Seale said. In addition to the retreat, WASC members have surveyed 1,800 Paly students in their English classes and talked individually with a few\u00a0hundred, according to Garrison.\r\n\r\nIt took Garrison 18 months to craft WASC\u2019s goals. \u201cThey\u2019re extraordinarily powerful, but they\u2019re very lofty, so it's going to take a lot of work for us [to meet them],\u201d Garrison said.\r\n\r\n\"I specifically pushed for targeting student stress and reevaluating the phrase 'fear of failure'. Both of these ended up in the three goals,\" Tai-Seale said.\r\n\r\nWASC\u00a0analyzed data from the California Department of Education\u2019s website to find Paly\u2019s areas of improvement.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are a lot of things we look at, everything from basic demographics \u2013 student demographics, teacher demographics, so that\u2019s ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, students with IEP [Individualized Education Program] plans,\u201d Garrison said, \u201cto the big standardized tests like STAR [Standardized Testing and Reporting]\".\r\n\r\n\"We look at the number of students taking APs and the average scores they get and ... compare [Paly] to other schools in our county and in California,\u201d Garrison said.\r\n\r\nWithout accreditation, students\u2019 transcripts are not accepted by most colleges. A school is accredited for a period of six years at the end of which\u00a0a new cycle starts and the school must be evaluated again. As part of the WASC evaluation, a high school must not only pinpoint the school\u2019s weaknesses, but create a strategy to strengthen them, which Garrison and WASC leaders plan to achieve now that Paly's goals have been released.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Paly is creating an action plan for the next six years following the Western Association of Schools and Colleges Coordinator Emily Garrison's release of the three goals for the next accreditation cycle on Tuesday in the Media Arts Center atrium.","date":"2014-10-23 22:52:24","author":"Maya McNealis","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_4408.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"30880":"accreditation cycle","30877":"Arin Tai-Seale","30878":"Garrison","30879":"Paly goals","27774":"WASC"}},{"id":76893,"title":"&#8220;Must have&#8221; Spirit Week outfits","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/23\/must-have-spirit-week-outfits\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_76987\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"585\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Screen-Shot-2014-10-23-at-1.16.51-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-76987\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Screen-Shot-2014-10-23-at-1.16.51-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-10-23 at 1.16.51 PM\" width=\"585\" height=\"321\" \/><\/a> During Spirit Week's color day last year, the freshmen wore orange, sophomores wore red, juniors wore yellow and seniors wore green.

Louder, louder than a lion.\u201d Don\u2019t be afraid to unleash your inner animal for this day. For a little inspiration, feel free to reenact the beginning scene of \"The Lion King\" by raising the smallest person you can find to the sun and yelling, \u201cIt\u2019s the circle of life.\u201d Although you may get weird looks from your friends, be sure to have confidence like the lion that you\u2019ll be dressed as.\u00a0If you are struggling with dressing up as a character from \"The Lion King,\" you\u00a0can extend the theme to all Disney characters. However, it's recommended that freshmen dress up as Lion King-specific characters. You\u00a0can wear all pink to represent a flamingo, or black and white to represent a zebra. If you\u2019re freaking out about not knowing what to wear, just remember \u201cHakuna Matata.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>[Tuesday] Dressing day <\/strong>-<strong> Healthy Choice: <\/strong>Healthy choice day is a day to dress up like the athlete you were never successful in becoming. Biking, running, lacrosse, golf or football \u2013 it's\u00a0time to pick whichever sport you please. Try to stick with one sport throughout the whole outfit, because we really don\u2019t want to see a biker\u2019s helmet with a jersey and a swimsuit bottom. If you\u2019re going for the runner\u2019s look, please keep in mind that if you wouldn\u2019t wear it on your run, don\u2019t wear it. People don\u2019t want to see your pasty thighs in the athletic shorts you'd never wear. And would you really\u00a0exercise with your hair down? We think not. To complete the look, bring a water bottle of choice \u2013 even better, have it be\u00a0orange, your class color.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Wednesday] Color day - Orange:<\/strong> Orange you glad you\u2019re a freshman? Head on over to Target or Spirit and buy a variety of orange items: tights, shorts, shirts (or wear your class shirt if you bought one), tutus, boas, sunglasses and socks. You can even buy one of those 69-cent mini pumpkins from Trader Joe's to place on your orange spray-painted head. Just remember to go all-out and find everything you can that\u2019s orange. Color day\u2019s an easy day, no matter the color.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Thursday] Generation day - Babies: <\/strong>Cherish this day, because it is by far one of the comfiest days you will experience all year. If you\u2019re feeling stumped on outfit choices, we recommend looking back on all your #tbt pics on Instagram for some inspiration. Our tips: wear a onesie. Don\u2019t limit yourself to the typical, patternless onesies; look around and find unique, flashy or character-oriented onesies. To accompany your outfit, you can wear a saggy diaper with a bonnet. A binky, pacifier or bottle of milk is a nice addition to all baby days as well. Feel free to bring your favorite stuffed animal to school, and please don\u2019t act like you don\u2019t have any more stuffed animals, because we all secretly snuggle with one at night.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Friday] Paly - Green and White: <\/strong>Wear absolutely all the Paly gear that you can find stashed somewhere in your closet. If you can\u2019t seem to find much, look for any green and white clothing located around the house. We want to see green and white hair with green and white faces on the last day of the best week.

Try to grow a beard within the next few days since most working cowboys don\u2019t have time to shave on the ranch. Overalls are a great addition to any ranch outfit as well, and don't forget your bandana. Remember, if you're ever feeling down, just saddle up.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Wednesday] Color day - Red:<\/strong> This is a super easy color to dress up for.\u00a0All you have to do is find any red items you can scavenge around the house. If that\u2019s not enough, head on over to Target or Spirit. You\u00a0can wear red shirts, tights, tutus, boas, sunglasses, socks and more. To top off the look, take your brightest red nail polish and lipstick and apply. Guys, too.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Thursday] Generation day - Teenyboppers: <\/strong>We personally didn\u2019t know much about Teenyboppers last year, so here are a few definitions to help clear up the confusing term. \u201cThe term was introduced in the 1950s to refer to teenagers who mainly listened to pop music and\/or rock and roll and not much else,\u201d according to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Teenybopper\">Wikipedia<\/a>. Teenyboppers are also synonymous to Greasers, a youth subculture that originated in the '50s among teenagers. Take your inspiration from outfits in the popular movie \u201cGrease\u201d or by searching images for \u201cFashion for teenage boys\/girls in the 1950s.\u201d For guys: it is time to apply lots and lots of gel. We recommend buying two bottles just in case you happen to run out. Make sure to reapply during break, lunch, passing periods and class itself - remember, you can never have too much gel. The gel will give you a sleek-haired look that\u2019ll take you straight back to the '50s. For girls: Wear poodle skirts (a few that can be borrowed from Paly\u2019s Theatre Department), red lip stick, \u201cpink lady\u201d jackets and your mother\u2019s pearls that you\u2019ve always been looking for an excuse to wear.\u00a0Don\u2019t forget your leather jacket with boots or Chuck Taylors, which can be bought for $10 at certain thrift stores.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Friday] Paly - Green and White: <\/strong>Wear absolutely all the Paly gear that you can find stashed somewhere in your closet. If you can\u2019t seem to find much, look for any green and white clothing located around the house. We want to see green and white hair with green and white faces on the last day of the best week.

The pirate theme, at least for us, seems to be a relatively hard day to dress up for. If you put yourself in a situation where you've been at sea for many months and you potentially have scurvy, it's alright to assume that you won\u2019t have the most glamorous outfit. Grab a large, flowy, white t-shirt and cut off the ends of the sleeves and the bottom of the shirt in a jagged manner. Paint blue stripes across the front and back of the shirt. For accessories, you can wear a bandana around your neck, a pirate belt, eye patch, one large hoop earring and a plastic sword. Don\u2019t forget to say \u201cAhoy, matey\u201d to everyone you pass by on your way to class.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_77006\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"254\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_5912.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-77006\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_5912.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_5912\" width=\"254\" height=\"381\" \/><\/a> Staff writer\u00a0Claire Krugler poses in a chicken suit for the junior's yellow color day that falls on the third day of Spirit Week.

If you want to think outside the box, dress up as a scuba diver with flippers; but make sure that you take the walking backwards approach or we might see a few scratched up faces at the rally. Boys, start working on those abs ASAP (we recommend the local gym). Have no fear of the bright tropical colors and floral patterns that you'll be wearing on this day. For all juniors, grab your dad\u2019s oversized Hawaiian shirt, shorts, hula skirts, coconut bras, leis and flip-flops, and you\u2019re good to go.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Wednesday] Color day - Yellow: <\/strong>If you\u2019re going for the <i>\u201c<\/i>wear whatever I can find that is yellow\" look, we recommend patrolling through your house, finding all yellow items and placing them on your body with yellow tape. See that banana? Ring, ring, bringing the banana phone back.\u00a0See that highlighter? That's your writing utensil for the day.\u00a0On the other hand, there are also character-specific outfits such as banana costumes, minion suits and Spongebob outfits. If you combine the \u201cwear whatever I can find that is yellow\" look with the costume specific outfit, you may find yourself in the running for Best Dressed.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Thursday] Generation day - Sophisticates:<\/strong> Dress for success. Ladies and gentleman, this is the day to impress all your fellow peers by looking like a successful and accomplished lady and gentleman that you will soon become. Pick your favorite role model and be them for the day. Ladies tend to either wear dresses, skirts with fancy blouses or pant suits. Each of these items can be paired with flats or heels, but keep in mind that you may want some practice with running in heels if you plan to get a good spot on the bleachers during the rallies. Gentlemen can bring on the tux and ties, with a briefcase in hand. Don\u2019t forget your cup of coffee in the morning and your handy pocket book dictionary and thesaurus, which we hope you read the night before so that you\u2019ll look astute for Sophisticates day.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Friday] Paly - Green and White:\u00a0<\/strong>Wear absolutely all the Paly gear that you can find stashed somewhere in your closet. If you can\u2019t seem to find much, look for any green and white clothing located around the house, which we'll imagine shouldn't be too hard as this is your third Spirit Week.

Why not try both? Seniors, it is time to start paying for those rollerblading lessons ASAP. Although we would enjoy seeing a few of you face-plant on the Quad, we will also pity you, so here are our words of advice. And since boomboxes typically weigh around 30 pounds, it\u2019s time to hit the gym. We expect to be seeing at least half of the seniors at our next YMCA visit. Better start on your lifelong dream to become a rollerblader with the most fly tunes.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>[Tuesday] Dressing day -\u00a0Caesar:\u00a0<\/strong>For toga tips, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Make-a-Toga-out-of-a-Bedsheet\">here<\/a>. Use extra safety pins for your toga because we really don\u2019t want to see any slips. Ride in eating grapes on your chariot with a little bit of \u201cwine,\u201d aka grape juice. Fight in the colosseum wearing your gladiator sandals, and take a break by playing a soothing harp song.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_77015\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"204\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_5990.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-77015\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_5990.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_5990\" width=\"204\" height=\"306\" \/><\/a> Staff writers Adele Bloch and Claire Krugler pose for senior's green color day and camp day, which respectively fall on the third and last day of Spirit Week.
