This included first and second place in both categories of Lighting and Sound. In addition, two students won statewide scholarships.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s exceptional,\u201d Woods said. \u201cThat\u2019s really, really unusual for any one school to have that much.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith talented resources in the department, Woods is looking forward to the year ahead with regards to ComedySportz.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery ComedySportz event that I\u2019ve attended \u2026 is just very clever and sharp and quick,\" Woods said. \"It\u2019s just a lot of fun to watch as an audience member, and it\u2019s really rewarding for the students participating in the improv.\u00a0I\u2019m really looking forward to the added element of having ComedySportz.\u201d","excerpt":"For the first year ever, the Palo Alto High School Theatre Department will partake in competitive improvisation as part of its newly-created ComedySportz team.","date":"2014-10-10 13:30:11","author":"Samuel Desr\u00e9","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_8527.jpg","categories":["Entertainment"],"tags":{"29694":"chris hinstorff","29692":"comedy sports","29691":"comedysportz","29693":"improv","29689":"kathleen woods","9159":"theater","9160":"theatre","29695":"thespian","29690":"zoe limbrick"}},{"id":75828,"title":"Highlights from Sen.

As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I'm here to tell you that I will not let that happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make no mistake, America's intelligence [agencies] are made up of thousands of overwhelmingly dedicated men and women who make enormous sacrifices to protect this nation. No one that I know in the senate or at this table wants to deprive our intelligence agencies of the tools that will actually make the world safer. But it's now clear that dragnet surveillance conflicts with core American values and doesn't make us\u00a0safer.\r\n\r\n\"The government ought to stop requiring American companies to participate in this suspicion-less collection of customers data and begin the process of rebuilding trust at home.\"\r\n\r\n<b><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Microsoft Brad Smith<\/span><\/b>\r\n\r\n\"Just as people would not put their money in a bank they don't trust, they will be reluctant to put their information in a data center or in a phone they don't trust.\"\r\n\r\n\"When trust is shattered, it needs to be rebuilt.\"\r\n\r\n\"[We need]\u00a0to go back to the fundamental personal rights that are at stake. I think all of us stand for a straightforward proposition: If you're a consumer or a company, you own your email, your text messages, your photos and all the content that you create. Even when you put your content in our data centers or the devices that we make, you still own it. You are entitled to the legal protection under our Constitution and our laws, and we will not rebuild trust until our own government recognizes that straightforward principle.\"\r\n\r\n<strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Executive Chairman of Google Eric Schmidt<\/span><\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"We want to thank you [Sen. Wyden] for being a phenomenal champion for technology [and] for jobs. And I think, and we probably all think, that you are a true patriot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank goodness that you [Sen. Wyden] led the fight against bulk surveillance, but things are getting worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think the simplest outcome is that we're going to end up breaking the Internet. What's going to happen is the government will ... eventually say, 'We want our own Internet in our own country because we want it to work our way. We don't want the NSA and other people in it.'\u00a0The cost of that is huge, in terms of knowledge, discovery, science, growth and jobs.\"\r\n\r\n<strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #000000;\">General Counsel of Facebook Colin Stretch<\/span><\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"One of the biggest challenges we're confronting as an industry is the inability for most of the world's population to access the Internet. ... Eighty percent\u00a0of the people without Internet access around the world are within range of a cell tower. The reason they do not have Internet access is because it costs too much. One of the big challenges for us as an industry is to bring technology to\u00a0address that problem, to get the rest of the world. Data localization takes us in exactly the wrong direction, simply because it costs too much money.\"\r\n\r\n\"From our perspective, the most profoundly disturbing [disclosures] was ... hacking, the sort of things we do see from some other countries that are involved with state-sponsored espionage. That put the relationship between the\u00a0industry and the U.S. government on a slightly different footing. ... What those disclosures\u00a0[hacking]\u00a0brought to light was there was this effort outside of what we all thought of as the appropriate legal process to attain user data. ... It placed renewed focus on our need to protect ourselves from these\u00a0sorts of unauthorized overseas attacks.\"\r\n\r\n<strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #000000;\">General Counsel of Dropbox Ramsey Homsany<\/span><\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"We need to be committed to providing good security and encryption for our users.\"\r\n\r\n\"Encryption is a critically important technology for everything we do and everything that happens on the Internet. Why would we start to hamper with it ... rather than wanting to develop great encryption and apply it so that consumers can have a lot of trust and faith in the fact that what they do store online is safe? There are many other ways for the government to get data when they're doing investigations ... which has been the legal norm for hundreds of years.\"\r\n\r\n<strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Partner of Greylock Partners John Lilly<\/span><\/strong>\r\n\r\n\"Most people want to follow the law.\u00a0Most people want to stay safe\u00a0... but [there's] this\u00a0bifurcation of citizenry and law enforcement and government, and we're getting a drumbeat of that, and that's increasingly the society we do not want.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"At a Senate Finance Committee Chairman's roundtable held yesterday in the Paly Big Gym, United States Sen.

Not only is she the first (and only) American to have competed at the Olympic Games prior to the Youth Olympic Games, but Zhang is also the first to win a table tennis medal at the Olympic level for the U.S. She secured a bronze medal in women\u2019s singles table tennis last month at the Youth Olympics in Nanjing, China. After a victorious trip overseas, Zhang returned to the Bay Area to pursue her college education at University of California, Berkeley.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice caught up with Zhang to learn more about her experiences as a professional athlete.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Paly Voice:<\/strong> When\u00a0and why did you start playing table tennis?\r\n\r\n<strong>Lily Zhang:<\/strong> I started playing at the age of seven when my friend took me to the Palo Alto Table Tennis Club.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> What has been your favorite part about playing?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> There's so much that drew me to table tennis. I love the rapidity of the game, the vast amount of different strategies and styles, the mental aspect of the sport and I especially love traveling for tournaments and learning about the various cultures of the world.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> What are your hopes or expectations of the table tennis program at UC Berkeley?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> I know that UC Berkeley has one of the best table tennis teams in the nation and I already know many of the players on the team, so I'm extremely excited to join the team. I also hope to help the team win gold at the College Nationals next semester.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> How do you think the demands of a college student will affect your training?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> It's definitely much harder to practice here because of the demands of college, but I'm going to try to push myself to practice as much as I can on the weekends, as well as go home to my club on some weekends to practice.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> How has your experience at the Youth Olympic Games helped you as a professional athlete?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> Participating in the Youth Olympic Games has given me so much experience I can take with me to future tournaments or events. I think my mental game improved significantly after the Games, as I was able to calm myself down and breathe deeply whenever I got too nervous there.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> What\u2019s the most helpful advice your coach or anyone has ever given you?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> l think the most helpful advice I received was from my parents. Unlike many other parents in this sport, my parents never, ever pushed me to play table tennis and always gave me the choice to pursue what I wanted. In doing so, they helped me realize that I play because I truly love the sport, not because I was pushed or forced to.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> Do you have any advice for current Paly athletes?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> I guess my advice to current Paly athletes would be something along the same lines: Pursue something you're really passionate about\u00a0because you will work hard to achieve your goals, but at the same time, really enjoy doing it.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong> What are the next steps in your table tennis career?\r\n\r\n<strong>LZ:<\/strong> I'm still trying to work it out with my professors, but I'm hoping to attend the 2014 World Junior Championships in Shanghai, China. It'll be my seventh time playing World Juniors, and my goal is to win the first ever medal for the U.S. there.","excerpt":"Making Olympic history for the United States is not something a typical 18-year-old can check off his or her bucket list.

Palo Alto High School students are welcome and are encouraged to participate at the event.\r\n\r\nChefs from popular Bay Area restaurants are running workshops so that students can learn more about food in a qualitative way, according to Tasting Week event organizers. Some of the PAUSD schools participating will be Escondido Elementary School and Barron Park Elementary School, according to the Tasting Week Calendar on the website.\r\n\r\nOn a press release on Monday, PAUSD Communications Coordinator Tabitha Kappeler-Hurley wrote that some of the chefs leading the workshops include c<span style=\"color: #222222;\">hef Charlie Ayers from Calafia in Palo Alto, chef Marco Fossati from Four Seasons in Palo Alto and chef Nathan Beriau from Ritz Carlton in San Francisco.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe top chefs are visiting local schools to blossom students\u2019 love for food, share new tastes and aromas, as well as teach students alternatives to unhealthy food options, according to Kappeler-Hurley.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe idea to have Bay Area schools launch this celebration of food came from a group of Bay Area parents who believe that educating children about taste is the best way to get them to love food and, at the same time, to fight obesity,\u201d\u00a0Kappeler-Hurley wrote.\r\n\r\nAfter its launch in Palo Alto four years ago, Tasting Week has\u00a0now expanded to schools across the bay in cities such as San Francisco and Berkeley. The founder of the organization of the Bay Area Tasting Week organization is Rebecca Scholl-Barbier, a Palo Alto parent with four children in the PAUSD.\r\n\r\nSome students see the benefits of the event and are eager to sample and learn about the different tastes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d want to go to a workshop,\u201d Walter Hays Elementary fifth grader Hana Krieger said. \u201cI think it [Tasting Week] is good because it gives students a chance to try things for free.\u201d\r\n\r\nOthers understand the goal of Tasting Week, and see how it can educate people.\r\n\r\n\u201cA lot of people who don\u2019t know how to cook would want to go to the event,\" junior Isabelle Vincent said. \"People who don\u2019t really know what goes in their food can develop healthier eating habits [at the workshops].

Having to complete two different mini-games under time pressure on different sides of the screen is harder than it looks, but oh-so-addicting.","date":"2014-10-09 13:47:33","author":"Maddy Jones","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/11.jpg","categories":["APPetite","Spotlight"],"tags":{"29811":"2f1b","29416":"APPetite","29478":"blog","29810":"two fingers one brain"}},{"id":75684,"title":"What&#8217;s in my bag: Natalie Holler","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/09\/whats-in-my-bag-natalie-holler\/","content":"<code><img class=\"alwaysThinglink\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" src=\"\/\/cdn.thinglink.me\/api\/image\/576136198569852929\/1024\/10\/scaletowidth#tl-576136198569852929;1043138249'\" alt=\"\" \/><script src=\"\/\/cdn.thinglink.me\/jse\/embed.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/code>\r\n\r\nAs part of The Paly Voice's \"What's in my Bag\" series to find out more about students at Paly, this week we sat down with senior Natalie Holler.

But the growing dependency on this product and the technology behind it is transforming the culture of Palo Alto High\u00a0School. Technology represents the language of the next generation, the top end of the education spectrum and a community that\u2019s pushing the boundaries of innovation. But what is\u00a0Paly's latest obsession, both in the classroom and on the Quad?\u00a0The smartphone.\r\n\r\nSophomore Samarth Venkatasubramaniam agrees: \u201cBoth students and teachers [are] becoming really dependent on their smartphones,\" Venkatrasubramaniam said. \"Many teachers \u2026 ask you to pull out your phone and \u2018take this quiz\u2019 or \u2018use this app\u2019. And students \u2026 communicate using their phone whether it\u2019s chatting or texting and calling or Snapchatting \u2026 they\u2019re always on their phones for communication or studies.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe presence of iPhones and other smartphones in the classroom is viewed as an influence that can both help and distract. Students have a tendency to get distracted when they use their phones, but junior Ella Higashi thinks there are benefits that outweigh the risk of distraction.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy history class used them [smartphones] the other day, and I think it was helpful,\" Higashi said. \"Sometimes ... in science you can use your phone to upload things to the screen, which is really good for visual learning.\"\r\n\r\nSenior Claire Priestley also feels distraction\u00a0should not be a major concern when using smartphones\u00a0educationally.\r\n\r\n\u201cTeachers are really concerned with you not being on task with your phone but I think the majority of the people will stay on task because most people here are really good people,\u201d Priestley said.\r\n\r\nThe increasing use of smartphones in classroom activities may be due to an overall increase in smartphone ownership, specifically, iPhone ownership.\u00a0In a study entitled \u201cSmartphone Ownership in 2013,\u201d the Pew Research Center found that \u201cthose from the upper end of the income and education spectrum are much more likely than those with lower income and educational levels to say they own an iPhone.\" The study found that 25 percent of cellphone users in the U.S. own an iPhone.\r\n\r\nThe iPhones is\u00a0known\u00a0for its\u00a0beautiful design and intuitive interface. However, students like Higashi argue that the Apple product is overrated and that phones should be valued for their functionality instead of their beauty.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think other smartphones can do the same stuff as iPhones,\" Higashi said. \"I think it\u2019s more of the name \u2018iPhone.'\"\r\n\r\nAccording to senior Maeve Lavelle, the popularity of iPhones and the power of the brand name seems to only have increased with time.\r\n\r\n\u201cFreshman year it was kind of like, \u2018Oh, you have an iPhone, cool. I don\u2019t,\u2019 but it was still acceptable. By senior year everyone has an iPhone except for maybe the odd few, and if you don\u2019t have one by now, it\u2019s kind of like \u2018Oh, what\u2019s up with you?\u2019\u201d Lavelle said, who is an owner of an iPhone 5S.\r\n\r\nOne aspect that contributes to iPhone ownership may just be a matter of familiarity with the iPhone and an unwillingness to step out of the comfort zone of Apple products. \u201cI\u2019ve only had an iPhone... so I don\u2019t really know how to use phones that aren\u2019t iPhones,\u201d Priestley said. \u201cI think I\u2019d always stick with the iPhone because it\u2019s just what I know.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe iPhone can be either be perceived as a positive result of technology or an unnecessary display of money. iPhone culture is the feeling that an iPhones is the only acceptable type of phone, and that not having an iPhone is a huge loss and disadvantage.\r\n\r\n\u201c[iPhone culture] is a result of us being in the upper-middle class to upper class, and it\u2019s kind of a gross display of our wealth,\u201d junior Sean Jawetz said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it has a positive or negative effect on the culture of our student body.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dependency on smartphones shows that the technology culture is unnaturally strong and the iPhone culture even stronger. Paly students recognize that Paly\u2019s iPhone culture is the exception, not the rule.\r\n\r\nAs Venkatasubramaniam puts it, \u201cPhones are practical, obviously.That\u2019s why people use them.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_75349\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_97991.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-75349\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_97991.jpg\" alt=\"Sophomore Ciara Bleahen and sophomore Alicia Mies use their iPhones to listen to music and study in the library.
