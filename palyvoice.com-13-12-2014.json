More practical subjects should be included in the course. Photo by Maya McNealis.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nLiving Skills: a\u00a0rite of passage that all Palo Alto High School students must complete to graduate high school and prove that they are prepared for adulthood. A class that should cover such interesting and important topics as applying for a job, managing finances, nutrition, and health. A class that is only a semester of basic education on mental, sexual and emotional health, which are all important topics but\u00a0should be taught with the addition of topics like managing household appliances and transportation.\r\n\r\nWhile we commend the Palo Alto Unified School District for covering challenging health topics relevant to adult life, we believe that Living Skills should be revised to include education on managing finances and entering and navigating the workforce.\r\n\r\nThe Living Skills class was originally created because Paly parents were worried about teen pregnancy and student knowledge about safe sex practices, according to Living Skills teacher Letitia Burton. The current Living Skills class also focuses on topics such as teen depression, mental health and racism. Though these are all very important topics that ought to be discussed with all Paly students, we believe that the course should include a greater focus on everyday life skills including taxes, managing\u00a0a household and keeping of track of money.\r\n\r\nSome people may feel that teaching students to protect their physical and mental health should be the top priority. We agree, but if students do not know how to pay their utility bills, and therefore don\u2019t have hot water and electricity, Paly will be doing a poor job of protecting their health.\r\n\r\nAnother argument that is used to justify the Living Skills curriculum is that the class was created to address depression and pregnancy. However, students feel that\u00a0QPR (the question, persuade, respond method of combating depression) and sexual education can be taught faster than they currently are. Some students, like junior Aiva Petriceks, believe that the current Living Skills content could be compressed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time just talking about race and stuff,\u201d Petriceks said. \u201cI think we spent a couple weeks on it ... but I think that kind of stuff you just need a day to do.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe feel that especially after tragedies such as Ferguson, topics such as racial identity and affirmative action are definitely important to discuss. One day would not be a long enough time to cover these topics, but\u00a0if the class was streamlined a bit there would be time for subjects such as managing budgets and entering the workforce.\r\n\r\nAlthough Paly offers other resources, like the required semester of Economics and the four-year Advisory system, those courses should not be students\u2019 sole sources of information on managing finances and applying for jobs. Living Skills would be a better course to introduce such basic skills because managing money is a skill needed in independent adult life.\r\n\r\nSenior Anna Zhang, who took Living Skills in\u00a0summer school, says\u00a0that the class could benefit from new additions to the curriculum.\r\n\r\n\u201cA lot of things that could actually be applied to life were not taught,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cBut [my teacher] did ask for our feedback and we asked him to teach us about taxes and insurance. He did go over that with us even though it wasn\u2019t in the curriculum. I feel like a lot of other classes didn\u2019t have that opportunity.\u201d\r\n\r\nHowever, when asked, Burton said there was no room for additional material.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs much as finances would be really interesting, it [the class] is only one semester,\u201d Burton said. \u201cAnd within that one semester we\u2019ve got a lot of curriculum to cover. There just really isn\u2019t time or space to add anything else. If Living Skills was a year long class? Yeah. But as things stand now, there\u2019s just not enough time.\u201d\r\n\r\nBurton explained that she understands the false impressions that accompany the name of the course.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know students like to think \u2018Oh, well it should be a class on living skills cause its called \u2018Living Skills,\u2019 but really students need to understand that this is primarily a health class, where we look at physical, social and emotional health issues,\u201d Burton said.\r\n\r\nAll Living Skills classes should ask for student feedback to see if students would like to learn about practical topics, such as finances and household management. The purpose of high school is to equip teenagers with the skills that adults use to thrive in the real world, which is why we believe that our proposed additions to the one-semester Living Skills curriculum is vital. Sometimes the simple, practical skills are the most important, and Paly should make sure students are taught all of them.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Living Skills.

Suddenly, I hear a knock at the door. It\u2019s Life. Life arrogantly enters without my invitation and immediately begins to shout, \u201cYooo maaaa, I brought you some lemons.\" I sigh, \u201cLife, what are you doing? It is 2 o'clock in the morning, what do you expect me to do with lemons?\u201d And Life is like, \u201cMake lemonade, Stupid!\u201d and I am like, \u201cLife, I have five finals\u00a0to study for. I do not have time to make lemonade.\"<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_80207\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"373\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/DSC_0009.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-80207\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/DSC_0009.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_0009\" width=\"373\" height=\"250\" \/><\/a> Lemons that Life dropped off at my house last night. Life was all like, \"Lemonsss?\" and I was all like, \"APUSHHH?\" Photo by Saba Moussavian[\/caption]\r\n\r\nYou are probably wondering two things right now:\r\n\r\n1. Why is Life talking like that?\r\n2. What the heck is going on here?\r\n\r\nTo answer the first question, I don\u2019t know why Life is talking like that. I guess Life just kinda does his\/her (Life is gender-ambiguous) own thing.\r\n\r\nTo answer the second question, let me tell you where we are: We are in the pre-final zone. \u00a0Life is currently dropping off a lot of lemons. Sometimes, more\u00a0lemons than we can handle.\r\n\r\nSo, we are left to question, \"How will I maintain my sanity throughout the pre-final zone?\" Using advice from Social Sciences\u00a0teacher Alexander Davis and what I have learned as an experienced junior, I have constructed a list of ways to deal with this large intake of citrus juice.\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Organize the lemons<\/strong>\r\nI\u2019ve got math, and history, and bio, and English, and \u2014 whoa, chillax bruh! I know it may seem like you have a lot, and you probably do, but there is no need to panic. Grab a piece of paper and a pencil and make lists. How many finals do you have? What do you need to study for each final? How much time do you need for each task? Make a calendar to schedule for when you will work on what \u2014 maybe even color-code it. Finals studying is all about being on top of your work. Spreading out the big jumble of work you have onto a piece of paper will also hopefully show you that this isn\u2019t impossible.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Take one lemon at time<\/strong>\r\nI know teachers tell us this all the time, but I\u2019m going to say it anyways: Don\u2019t procrastinate \u2014 break your work up, spread it out. All of your work left for the night before can be more\u00a0lemons than possible to handle. But, you can probably deal with a basket of lemons a day, or even a few lemons an hour.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Prioritize between which lemons are more important to handle<\/strong>\r\nIf you have five finals to study for and a limited amount of time, odds are you won\u2019t be able to get to all of them. Consider which subject you are struggling in most and in which class the grade matters most.\r\n\r\nI encourage all of you to calculate the grade you need on your final in order to achieve your desired grade in the class \u2014 not to give yourself the overconfidence of being able to flunk the final, but so you can be aware of exactly where you stand in each class.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Tell your teachers about all the lemons you have<\/strong>\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know, your teacher wants you to do well,\" Davis said. \"Your teacher isn\u2019t trying to screw you over.\"\r\n\r\nYes, there remain a hand full of oddball teachers who I am still convinced are plotting against me, but I have found that most teachers are willing to work to help you however possible in regards to finals and other issues. They probably can\u2019t make a test disappear, but can give you great advice on how to do well on your final. Oftentimes, teachers are also willing to let you take your final on a different day if the day you are scheduled to take it on is already overloaded.\r\n\r\n<strong>5.\u00a0Take a little sugar with your lemons<\/strong>\r\n\r\nJust because finals are important doesn't mean you have to suffocate yourself with work. Taking breaks to exercise, hang out with friends or\u00a0watch some TV can be healthy and might actually give you the energy to keep working. Maybe you'll want to catch up on 30 minutes of Netflix after every two hours of studying.\u00a0Whatever it is, remember: Lemons aren't so sour with a little bit of sugar.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Complain with your friends about all the sour lemons Life keeps giving you<\/strong>\r\nWalk into the library on finals week and I guarantee you there will be a good number of people complaining about their finals, maybe even more than there\u00a0are actually studying. And perhaps\u00a0that\u2019s not a bad thing!\r\n\r\nJust know that there are nearly 2,000 other people in this school ready to vent with you about how horrible their lives are right now; that\u2019s right, we\u2019re all in this together. Sometimes, just knowing you\u2019re not alone and getting out all that frustration can make you feel better. Maybe you can\u2019t make much lemonade by yourself, but if you get 2,000 people to make it with you \u2014 well, that\u2019s a lot of lemonade.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Remember that these lemons will be gone soon and you can have all the lemonade you want during your winter\u00a0break<\/strong>\r\nEight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one and then we\u2019re there. In less than two weeks you will be free(ish) from the stresses of school.\r\n\r\nBut, being free will also make your grades untouchable. This is your last chance to turn those \u201cB+s\u201d into \u201cA-s\u201d and \"C+s\" into \"B-s,\" so make it worth it.\r\n\r\nJust think of all the food, Netflix and sleep you will consume. Yes, it\u2019s true, Life will keep knocking on your door with more lemons, but sometimes you just need to chug and get through the rough parts, and thinking about how close you are to a break can help you do that.\r\n\r\nConsider these while you fight your way through the pre-finals stress or any other stressful studying time you may encounter in the future. And next time Life comes knocking at your door in the middle of the night delivering lemons, you can be all like, \"Cool, lemons. I can handle that.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Staff writer Saba Moussavian shares her experiences with pre-finals stress in a light-hearted, yet relatable analogy to lemons.","date":"2014-12-11 18:05:33","author":"Saba Moussavian","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/DSC_0009.jpg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":{"33420":"advice","34112":"alexander","34111":"austin","33421":"column","34113":"davis","10172":"finals","34110":"funny","33415":"lemons","33414":"life","34109":"stess","29936":"studying","34114":"xander"}},{"id":80154,"title":"Storm spouts leaks, leads to evacuations","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/12\/11\/storm-spouts-leaks-leads-to-evacuations\/","content":"<p>[caption id=\"attachment_80234\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"696\"]<img class=\" wp-image-80234\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_0417.jpg\" alt=\"A student walks through the flooded area of the campus near the Student Center.

It\u2019s not leadership like being in ASB or Congress,\u00a0but just as a citizen of this country how can you step into your leadership.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents may email any one of the teachers on the Camp Everytown Committee to nominate themselves, or they may be nominated by one of their teachers. The camp is from Jan. 15 to Jan. 18.\r\n\r\nThis year, Burton anticipates the discussion on race will bring up the Ferguson ruling and police brutality linked to racism.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure those issues will come up, as we deal with issues of race and ethnicity,\u201d Burton said. \"We deal with sexual orientation, we deal with gender issues and also family issues\".\r\n\r\nThis session, many students in the Associated Student Body and the Social Justice pathway are hoping to participate in the camp, but Burton hopes that any student, regardless of their interests and background, considers attending.\r\n\r\n\u201cAny student, any background, any socioeconomic status, any class, we want a full spectrum of kids from Paly,\u201d Burton said.\r\n\r\nJunior Dorothy Han, who attended the event last year, found it to be an eye-opening experience.\r\n\r\n\"It definitely shows you the privilege you have around you,\" Han said. \"It made me more compassionate toward others to know that we don't always know what is happening in other peoples' lives\".","excerpt":"Nominations to attend the annual Camp Everytown experience in January are due by email today.","date":"2014-12-11 14:10:22","author":"Maya McNealis","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/hug-necklace.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"8496":"ASB","10072":"camp everytown","10074":"letitia burton","34098":"nominations","9024":"race","34200":"social justice"}},{"id":79649,"title":"Opinion: Leave college reactions at home","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/12\/11\/opinion-leave-college-reactions-at-home\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_80200\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_1654.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-80200\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_1654.jpg\" alt=\"Seniors Jozy Prabhu and Ankita Avadhani scroll through college emails in the Paly Library.

You tap on the email from [insert name of the college of your choice], and\u00a0for a moment, the world seems to halt as you search for key words.\r\n\r\nSubmitting college applications can ignite a slew of stress and anxiety. But what's worse than this is that moment when other people announce to you the results of their applications when you have been rejected, have not heard back or have decided not to attend college.\r\n\r\nWe propose that seniors save all the college reactions for when they get home.\r\n\r\nPeople used to find out the fate of their applications when they returned home after school and checked the mail. No matter the results, their reactions were confined. Only family and close friends were privy to this information. These are the people who have helped you to this point and are there to congratulate or to console you.\r\n\r\nPeers in class, students on the Quad or teammates at practice are not people to whom you should turn. Yes, they could be proud and happy for your acceptance. Yes, they could empathize with and support you over a rejection. Yes, they could make you feel better. But you could make them feel worse. To hear that someone else was accepted to or even rejected from your dream school only increases the possible angst, disappointment and jealousy that surround college admissions.\r\n\r\nScreaming, whether of excitement or disappointment, is always inappropriate.\r\n\r\nSome people may simply not want the added distraction of college reactions during their classes. College decisions revealed in class have caused more awkwardness than positive reactions, according to Biology teacher Erik Olah.\r\n\r\n\"I've seen it where people hear about it in class and everyone else gets super happy, but then I've also seen it where someone's super happy and it gets really awkward for someone else who got rejected,\" Olah said. \"The safest thing would be to keep it at home, away from school.\"\r\n\r\nAssistant principal Jerry Berkson agrees that the best place to receive college decisions is at home.\r\n\r\n\"There might be some kid sitting right next to you who might not have gotten in where they want, meanwhile you're jumping up and down,\" Berkson said. \"I think the safest thing is to be with your family and let them enjoy your success or help you out with your disappointment.\"\r\n\r\nToday, Dec. 15, April 1 or any day in-between, we must resist the urge to gossip about, criticize others' or boast about our own college admissions decisions. By the end of the year, everyone will know your final choice. It is unnecessary to publicize all acceptances and rejections.\r\n\r\nWe will be keeping our college news relatively private, and we invite you to join us.\r\n\r\nSo, let's turn off our email notifications during school. Let's contain our impulses to ask others where they have gotten accepted or rejected. In doing so, we will be respecting not only our classmates but also ourselves.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Seniors should save college reactions for when they get home.

Photo by George Lu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nSo it starts raining, a lot. What are students and employees on Palo Alto High School campus supposed to do? Of course, we hope for the best, but let's also prepare for the worst scenarios in order to ensure the safety of all people on campus if an emergency situation were to occur. After all, San Francisco, Oakland and North Bay school districts have already <a title=\"School Closings: San Francisco, Oakland, North Bay Districts Cancel Classes\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcbayarea.com\/news\/local\/Bay-Area-School-Closings-285399581.html\" target=\"_blank\">canceled<\/a> school for tomorrow because of the storm, and\u00a0<a title=\"Castilleja\" href=\"http:\/\/www.castilleja.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Castilleja<\/a>\u00a0is currently considering canceling class. Here are some tips as to what to do during these times.\r\n\r\n<strong>1) What to do if the <a title=\"What to do during an electrical outage\" href=\"http:\/\/www.safeelectricity.org\/information-center\/library-of-articles\/62-storm-preparation-fallwinter\/318-what-to-do-during-an-electrical-outage\" target=\"_blank\">power goes out<\/a><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #545454;\">\u2014\u00a0<\/span>Stay away from fallen power lines, as they may still be active.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #545454;\">\u2014\u00a0<\/span>If you are on campus, stay on school grounds until given directions from a teacher or administrator.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #545454;\">\u2014\u00a0<span style=\"color: #222222;\">Turn off or disconnect any electronic equipment you were using when the power went out. (For people who sit in the back of the classroom to charge their iPhones,\u00a0this means you.)<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>2) What to do around heavily flooded areas<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #545454;\">\u2014\u00a0<\/span>Take caution when proceeding over the bridges set up by the school. We suggest wearing rain boots tomorrow so you don't need to use the bridges in the first place.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #545454;\">\u2014\u00a0<\/span>If an area seems unsafe, say something to an administrator or custodian so they can make it safe.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #545454;\">\u2014\u00a0<\/span>Do not go swimming in flooded areas.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_80105\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/405064_10200296470633798_1605053619_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-80105\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/405064_10200296470633798_1605053619_n.jpg\" alt=\"Paly alumnus Jack Anderson goes puddle jumping during a storm in November 2012.

Yes, this is the law, but it is extra important to remember this while\u00a0rushing to get to school on time.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #545454;\">\u2014\u00a0<\/span>Beware\u00a0of hydroplaning, which occurs\u00a0when a layer of water between your tires and the road causes your vehicle to skid,\u00a0resulting in a possible loss of control. Here are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rightturn.com\/tire-safety\/hydroplaning\/what-to-do\/\">instructions on what to do<\/a>\u00a0if your car begins to hydroplane.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #545454;\">\u2014\u00a0<\/span>Don't drive into flooded areas, ever. It is hard to tell how deep they are.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #545454;\">\u2014\u00a0<\/span>Drive with headlights on for better visibility during the day if possible.\r\n\r\nDuring these times, it is important to stay alert in order to ensure the safety of both you and those around you. If it's any consolation, it's supposed to be mostly sunny this weekend, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/forecast.weather.gov\/MapClick.php?lat=37.41776&amp;lon=-122.1235054&amp;lg=english&amp;FcstType=text&amp;TextType=2\">National Weather Service<\/a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"A storm is set to begin later tonight and Palo Alto is currently on high wind warning, flash flood watch, and hazardous weather outlook.

That's a big part of democracy \u2013 to express yourself in a peaceful way.\u00a0Frankly, I\u00a0wish students would do more of that here to express themselves.\"\n\nJunior Ariya Momeny felt that the protest was not well-timed and said he believed that if the protest supported the officers in question, the school would not be as supportive.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_80037\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"250\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_0197.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-80037\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_0197.jpg\" alt=\"Chalk outlines of bodies, phrases like &quot;Don't shoot&quot; and &quot;Black lives matter&quot; and names of unarmed minorities who have been killed by police officers were drawn around campus.
