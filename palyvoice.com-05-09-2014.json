We\u2019re pasture raised, USDA [United States Department of Agriculture] certified organic, grass-fed [and] grass-finished.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut that's not all: the company's do-it-yourself attitude extends past just the ownership of the farm and livestock.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_73167\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"360\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/MG_2854.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-73167\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/MG_2854.jpg\" alt=\"_MG_2854\" width=\"360\" height=\"240\" \/><\/a> A Philadelphia Cheesesteak ($12) from Belcampo Meat Co.\u00a0 Belcampo opened this past summer in Town and Country. Photo by George Lu[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\u201cWe also own our processing facility, which we built from the ground up. \u00a0So we own the farm, the processing facility, and the locations \u2014 that sets us apart from most restaurants. Most restaurants are going to be getting [produce] from some other source ... so that definitely sets us apart from everyone else.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is neither the first nor only Belcampo.\u00a0 Other Belcampo locations can be found scattered throughout the Bay Area and Southern California, some of which offer sit-down dining.\r\n\r\nIncluded on the Belcampo menu are the pulled pork bun, braised lamb belly bun, chili, steak salad, meatball sandwich and smoked jalapeno and cheddar sausage, all of which fall somewhere between $5 and $13.\r\n\r\nI ordered the Philadelphia Cheesesteak, BBQ Chicken Bun, and Belcampo Hot Dog\u00a0student special. The cheese steak, one of the most expensive item on the take-out menu at $12, was phenomenal. \u00a0The meat was juicy and tender and the cheese perfectly melted, while the hoagie bun was lightly toasted with a softer center. \u00a0I especially loved the generous helping of meat in the sandwich, as well as the noticeable freshness of the vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe chicken bun and the hot dog, both parts of Belcampo\u2019s student special, were equally impressive.\u00a0\u00a0The meat tasted fresh and the bun in particular had a good ratio of meat to barbeque sauce, which had a perfect sweet richness to it. \u00a0The only drawback was the portion size \u2014 for $5, I had expected to get something a bit bigger than the hockey puck-sized sandwich. \u00a0Even as part of the student special, the chicken bun is comparable to Lulu\u2019s student special in terms of price, but only offers a fraction of the serving size, even though it also comes with a side of fries.\r\n\r\nThe hot dog deal seemed a better deal in terms of amount of food, and was only $6, but the food was a bit more plain \u2014 it really was just a hot dog, bun, and side of fries, which I found to be extremely average in crunchiness and general taste. \u00a0The lack of condiments available at the store was also a turn-off as I felt that they could have added some needed flavor to the fries.\r\n\r\nOverall, while Belcampo certainly offers high quality food, hungry high school students might avoid it for the small serving sizes. \u00a0However, Belcampo still remains an excellent alternative to the other restaurants of Town and Country and should not be judged too quickly.\u00a0 Perhaps the most exciting prospect for the majority of high schools students is a plan to rotate items on the student special in order to let students experience the entire menu.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Boettcher also says to look out for additions to the menu unique to Palo Alto.\r\n\r\n\u201cEventually we\u2019re going to put out some specials and some things that are a little bit off to the side, like kind of secret menu items,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_73170\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"395\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_28301.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-73170\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_28301.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2830\" width=\"395\" height=\"263\" \/><\/a> Belcampo Meat Co. offers not only quality takeout food, but also fresh cuts of meat. Photo by George Lu[\/caption]\r\n\r\nBoettcher also expressed the possibility of expanding the site to include catering.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have a great opportunity here in Silicon Valley to provide our food to different companies in the area for luncheons or for conferences and meetings, so we\u2019re definitely trying to reach out to them at some point once we get the catering side of Belcampo up and running.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the moment, however, he said that Belcampo Palo Alto is focused on simply getting more exposure.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe definitely want to get our name out there and let people know that we\u2019re here, that we\u2019re providing a great service [and] a great quality product,\u201d Boettcher said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"At first glance, you would probably not guess that Belcampo Meat Co. in the Town and Country Shopping Center offered more than most butcher shops.

You don't realize how much stuff you have until you actually start moving, so when I started moving and I started really finding out how much stuff I have, it was bad. I mean I was making trips back and forth and it took forever, so that was basically my summer a lot of moving.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: What do you do in your free time?\r\n\r\n<strong>GV<\/strong>:\u00a0In my free time I love reading, I'm an English teacher. I love reading all types of genres: fiction, non-fiction, stuff like that. I also love walking my dog. I find it very therapeutic. I find that a little bit of exercise goes a long way in both physical and mental health.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: What is your favorite part of teaching?\r\n\r\n<strong>GV<\/strong>: My favorite part of teaching is making a connection with the students. I'm here for the students first, everything else second. When they learn and they understand things and they feel supported in a community that is their classroom, I feel like I've done my job.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: Do you have a favorite app?\r\n\r\n<strong>GV<\/strong>: I've been working on an app called ClassDogo. Basically what ClassDogo is that you can make a class roster with your students in them. Their little avatars online are little monsters so you put their names on [the avatars], they can log on to your classroom that you set up and basically it's a way for you to have a points management system. When kids are participating you give them credit for it and it's a way to track that. I have not implemented that yet, but I think I will very soon.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: Do you have pets?\r\n\r\n<strong>GV<\/strong>: I actually have a bunny, but it recently passed away...I'm probably going to get a new bunny. My dog is a Shiba Inu. It's very cute. [I have] two [mixed breeds of] cats, they get along with the dog. When the bunny was still there it was a pretty crowded place.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: What is the last movie you saw and did you like it?\r\n\r\n<strong>GV<\/strong>: \"Gravity\" just came out on HBO. Of course we watched it on a fairly big screen so I got the full effect of it. It's very dizzying and nauseous to watch that movie, but it was an amazing experience. Kudos to the director, you did an awesome job creating those special effects and those visuals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Meet the other English teachers:<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Bo Cheli\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/04\/new-english-teachers-bo-cheli\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bo Cheli <\/a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Trinity Klein\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/04\/new-english-teachers-trinity-klein\/\" target=\"_blank\">Trinity Klein<\/a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Richard Rodriguez\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/04\/new-english-teachers-richard-rodriguez\/\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Rodriguez<\/a>","excerpt":"George Vuong teaches both freshmen and sophomores in the accelerated lanes.

One of my daughters swims at a little swim club. My family took a trip back East. We went to Philadelphia, Maryland, D.C. and New York City. I spent some time in LA at the beginning and end of the summer and cleaned up little pet-projects around the house.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: What do you do in your free time?\r\n\r\n<strong>TK<\/strong>: I don't have any free time. I'm a working mother. I exercise as often as I can.

They are phenomenal\u00a0and coming back into the classroom after administration I'm very appreciative of the ability to really build relationships in the classroom and really get to know kids. They are what makes it a fun and energetic job.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: Do you have a favorite app?\r\n\r\n<strong>TK<\/strong>: Candy Crush.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: Do you have pets?\r\n\r\n<strong>TK<\/strong>: I have a little mutt named Jackson.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: What is the last movie you saw and did you like it?\r\n\r\n<strong>TK<\/strong>: \"Neighbors.\" It's hysterical, and it was good to see my former student Davey Franco in his breakout acting role.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Meet the other English teachers:<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Bo Cheli\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/04\/new-english-teachers-bo-cheli\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bo Cheli<\/a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Richard Rodriguez\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/04\/new-english-teachers-richard-rodriguez\/\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Rodriguez<\/a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"George Vuong\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/04\/new-english-teachers-george-vuong\/\" target=\"_blank\">George Vuong<\/a>","excerpt":"Trinity Klein teaches in the 10th grade accelerated lane.

I interviewed for this job and got it. I hung out a lot with my family and went to all of my daughter's soccer tournaments.\r\n\r\n<strong>T<\/strong><strong>PV<\/strong>: What do you do in your free time?\r\n\r\n<strong>BC<\/strong>: Play. I like to play sports with my wife. We're on a couple intramural teams together. I like to rock climb, indoor and outdoor. Mostly [I like to] wrestle with my kids and play in the backyard. I recently discovered a game called Spike Ball, it's a really fun game. As cheesy as it sounds I like to think about my classes and fun things we can do in my class, [such as] fun ways to teach them traditionally boring things.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: What is your favorite part of teaching?\r\n\r\n<strong>BC<\/strong>: There's lots. Showing students how fun it is to actually learn stuff that they used to think was boring and traditional, so actually igniting their knowledge for learning. That sounds so cheesy but getting to see how learning is actually really enjoyable.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: Do you have a favorite app?\r\n\r\n<strong>BC<\/strong>:\u00a0I can't say I have any favorite apps. I'm not a big app guy, I'm just usually busy playing. Maybe [my favorite app is] GPS so I don't get lost.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: Do you have pets?\r\n\r\n<strong>BC<\/strong>: I have two dogs and a snake and lots of fish.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV<\/strong>: What is the last movie you saw and did you like it?\r\n\r\n<strong>BC<\/strong>: \"Snowpiercer.\" It was On-Demand, you know that guy that plays Captain America? So \u00a0it's like his newest movie that not a lot of people have seen but it's about these ... people on a train and the train is the last thing that exists in the world and it's like traveling around the world and it was actually really good.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Meet the other English teachers:<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Trinity Klein\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/04\/new-english-teachers-trinity-klein\/\" target=\"_blank\">Trinity Klein<\/a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Richard Rodriguez\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/04\/new-english-teachers-richard-rodriguez\/\" target=\"_blank\">R<\/a><a title=\"Richard Rodriguez\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/04\/new-english-teachers-richard-rodriguez\/\" target=\"_blank\">ichard Rodriguez<\/a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"George Vuong\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/04\/new-english-teachers-george-vuong\/\" target=\"_blank\">George Vuong<\/a>","excerpt":"Bo Cheli is teaching freshmen and sophomores in both the accelerated and regular lanes of English.

A challenge grant is where the district matches money donated to the fund, according to PiE's website. The other campaign is the annual campaign that aims to surpass last year's record-breaking goal of amassing $5 million in donations, according to PiE Executive Director Kathy Schroeder.\r\n\r\n\"Our largest ever challenge grant is going on right now,\" Schroeder said. \"We raised $500,000 from general PAUSD [Palo Alto Unified School District] families to put up as a challenge so that others who give may have their gift to PiE matched by this challenge pool.\"\r\n\r\nEach fall, PiE raises money to support Palo Alto public schools.\r\n\r\n\"In general, gifts to PiE help improve PAUSD schools at every level, by offering classroom and student support in the form of aides, specialists, mentors and counseling ... electives and other hands-on programs to spark student interests in STEM [Science Technology Engineering and Math] and the arts,\" Schroeder said.\r\n\r\nThe $691,000 donation is given to Paly as flexible dollars, according to Schroeder.\r\n\r\n\"What we refer to as 'flexible dollars' is the pool of funds that each principal can use flexibly to provide staffing and programs most in line with their school priorities,\" Schroeder said. \"Some of these dollars come from the district, but over half at nearly every school come from PiE donors.\u00a0 Principals can choose to spend these dollars within PiE\u2019s focus areas as they and campus leaders deem best.\"\r\n\r\nPaly Principal Kim Diorio plans to use the funds to enhance student electives, staff Paly's new writing center, hire additional counselors, support the Teacher Advisor system, pay for upper-class Link Crew to facilitate Orientation and to fund College and Career Counseling, according to Schroeder. More info on each of these areas funded by PiE's donation can be found on PiE's <a href=\"http:\/\/papie.org\">website<\/a>.\r\n\r\nPiE is grateful to all who donate, as PAUSD is a community-funded district and these funds allow the district to provide the kind of education wanted for students, according to Schroeder.\r\n\r\n\"Donating to PiE allows parents, businesses and community members to invest in the future of our community, our youth, and our society,\" Schroeder said. \"It is a way to help ensure that our great schools remain outstanding, and to offer the support and broad electives choices to help make every student\u2019s experience at school the best it can be.\"\r\n\r\nTo donate, click\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/papie.org\/donate\/\">here<\/a>.","excerpt":"With two of the largest campaigns currently running and a recent donation of $691,000 to Palo Alto High School, the Partners in Education foundation helps keep the Palo Alto Unified School District to its standards.","date":"2014-09-04 13:08:58","author":"Maddy Jones","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/c79c29e8-f8d5-4fc2-ae06-9dbf97052555.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"12701":"2014","25041":"donation","25430":"kathy shroeder","8953":"paly","10169":"pie"}}]
