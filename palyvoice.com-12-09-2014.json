The friendly ambiance is accentuated by the warm coloring of the whole store and the employees' kindness.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_73662\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"773\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_63971.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-73662\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_63971.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6397\" width=\"773\" height=\"338\" \/><\/a> The store front view of David's Tea reveals a brightly colored store filled with many kinds of tea products, including both merchandise and tea. All employees are spirited, allowing customers to smell and touch any available teas. David's Tea had its grand opening on Aug. 30. \"It's been the warmest welcome we could have asked for,\" Hamel said.

On the right is a sleek white table, which the employees work behind, as well as a fully stocked wall of tea jars arranged by type:\u00a0white, green, oolong, black, pu\u2019erh, mate, rooibos and herbal, each with a designated\u00a0color on the wall.\r\n\r\nDavid\u2019s Tea has the greatest\u00a0number\u00a0of organic teas in North America, with over 50 organic teas in stock, according to Hamel. Ninety-eight percent of its blends are unique to the store,\u00a0including teas with added ingredients such as fruits, nuts, flowers and grasses. David\u2019s Tea sells over one hundred\u00a0types of loose-leaf teas as well as kosher teas and fair trade teas.\r\n\r\nDavid\u2019s Tea also sells products such as filters, tea bags, and chocolate with infused tea.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_73623\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"714\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_6394.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-73623\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_6394.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Adele Bloch.\" width=\"714\" height=\"536\" \/><\/a> David's Tea has an ever-expanding tea wall, because new tea\u00a0blends come out every month. David's Tea\u00a0currently has 150 teas that fall into eight different categories, each category labeled a separate color on the wall. Photo by Adele Bloch.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nEmployees take jars\u00a0off the wall to educate customers on the\u00a0content and flavor of the tea. A sample of the designated tea, which customers can smell and touch, sits on top of each jar. Each tea is composed of different ingredients that give it a distinct aroma and touch, bringing varying smells with each sniff.\r\n\r\nDavid\u2019s Tea began as an online company, and proceeded to open its\u00a0first physical location in 2008 in Canada\u2019s largest city, Toronto. By Christmas 2014, David\u2019s Tea will have 125 stores; 100 in Canada and 25 in the United States, according to Hamel.\r\n\r\n\u201cPalo Alto, being the center of Silicon Valley, really appealed to us, and it really seemed like the perfect location,\u201d Hamel said.\r\n\r\nEvery year, David\u2019s Tea comes out with six different collections of tea: fall, winter, holiday, spring, and two phases in the summer, according to Hamel. Every first day of the month there is a new tea launch that becomes a part of the permanent collection, Hamel said.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur tea wall is ever-expanding,\u201d Hamel said.\r\n\r\nNot only does David's Tea have a\u00a0large selection of\u00a0teas, it also offers various ways\u00a0to\u00a0make each kind of tea. Each tea flavor can be made hot, iced, in a pot, latte or tea pop.\r\n\r\nUnique to David's Tea, a tea pop is made by taking the desired tea flavor and adding Soda Stream, carbonated filtered water, for sparkling effect.\u00a0I chose to try the\u00a0Big Apple tea pop ($4), which was a great substitute\u00a0for soda, as it was fizzy but had much less sugar. When I took my first sip, I could sense an\u00a0apple flavor that felt cool to my throat,\u00a0with a\u00a0subtle sweet aftertaste. But a fair\u00a0warning: if the tea is not finished before the ice melts, the drink severely waters down the already\u00a0light flavors.\r\n\r\nBuddha\u2019s blend ($3.50), which Hamel said is one of the most popular teas, is composed of jasmine pearls, white hibiscus blossoms and natural and artificial flavoring, according to David\u2019s Tea <a title=\"David's Tea\" href=\"http:\/\/www.davidstea.com\/?&amp;currid=usd&amp;LN=EN\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a>. The tea had a slightly brown coloring and a smell that made me feel as though I was walking through a garden full of chrysanthemum flowers. The tea was flavorful, and held a light bitter aftertaste. The outside of the cup was nice and warm, making it a perfect drink for a winter day.\r\n\r\nThe iced Pumpkin Chai Latte ($4.50), which\u00a0its\u00a0website said is composed of black tea, cinnamon, cloves, lemon peel, carrots, caramel bits and pumpkin candies, was mixed with milk and Agave, a natural sweetener. The light brown drink was slightly bitter and very rich. Although the flavor was great, the smell brought me back to the holiday season, and to be honest, the aroma was probably better than the drink itself.\r\n<div class=\"_5wd4 _1nc7 direction_ltr _5yt9\" data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223\">\r\n<div class=\"_5wd9\" data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0\">\r\n<div class=\"_5wde\" data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0\">\r\n<div class=\"_5wdf _5w1r\" style=\"color: #3e454c;\" data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\"><span class=\"_5yl5\" data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0.0\">David's Tea has relatively similar prices to Teavana, a\u00a0competitor tea chain\u00a0in the area, but because David's Tea sells its items in a different fashion, it's hard to make a final judgment call on which store\u00a0offers better prices.<\/span>\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">At David's Tea, each tea takes about one to five minutes to make, depending on the kind of tea. However, the time flies quickly because customers can watch the tea being made, sample tea aromas\u00a0or browse through\u00a0the merchandise.\u00a0In the back of the store, there is a small room with four white tables, which provides\u00a0a calming setting to have\u00a0a\u00a0sip of tea. The calming background music, which varies in genres, is great to keep conversations lively.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_73624\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"719\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_6391.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-73624\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_6391.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6391\" width=\"719\" height=\"539\" \/><\/a> The back of the store holds an elongated white room that feels separate from the hectic front of the store, as it plays calm background music and is relatively quiet.

For every 100 points, customers can get two ounces of any tea on the house.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great way to get rewarded for buying the tea,\u201d Hamel said.\r\n\r\nDavid\u2019s Tea also provides an educational component to its\u00a0company\u00a0\u2014 tea school. Tea school covers the basics of tea production, how it\u2019s processed and what makes tea different. There are around two to\u00a0four tea schools per month, based off of demand, according to Hamel.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re really excited about the educational component as well for this location,\u201d Hamel said. \u201cWe also do private sessions so if offices or schools want us to come to them, we do that as well.\u201d\r\n\r\nDavid\u2019s Tea is very excited to be in Palo Alto just weeks after opening, according to Hamel.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the most wonderful welcome,\u201d Hamel said. \u201cPeople are very excited, and very open.

Paulson takes the place of Craig Tuana, who is now an assistant principal at Lynbrook High School.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice: Describe yourself in three words.\r\n\r\nAdam Paulson: I would say I am dedicated, passionate and funny. That\u2019s what would describe me. I have a good sense of humor.\r\n\r\nTPV: What are your first impressions of Paly?\r\n\r\nAP: Well, you know, I think it seems like a really great place to go to high school. Students, the facilities and the grounds \u2013 they\u2019re just tremendous. And from all the students and faculty I\u2019ve already talked to, it just seems like a place that has a lot of pride and school spirit, so I\u2019m excited about that.\r\n\r\nPV: What are you looking forward to this year at Paly?\r\n\r\nAP: I think mostly just trying to find that pulse. I\u2019m very much into school culture and the way students are thinking and feeling, really just trying to talk with as many students and student organizations and athletic organizations as I can so that I can get a pulse for what Paly is about and what the school culture is all about, you know? And try and find ways where I can interject and collaborate with students and teachers.\r\n\r\nPV: If you were a crayon, what color would you be, and why?\r\n\r\nAP: Trying to think back to some of those funky Crayola colors. Maybe a magenta-something that doesn\u2019t \u2014 that has a unique identity \u2013 is it blue? Is it green? I\u2019m a musician myself, too, so I like to express myself, and magenta is I think one of those mysterious colors.\r\n\r\nPV: What instruments do you play?\r\n\r\nAP: Anything with strings, you know,\u00a0guitar, bass.\r\n\r\nPV: Who\u2019s your favorite artist?\r\n\r\nAP: Now that would have to be a whole other interview, right? <em>(laughs).\u00a0<\/em>You know, I play anything from classical to heavy metal. Elvis Costello is one of my favorite musicians, just to name one.\r\n\r\nPV: As \"dean of students,\" what are students likely to see you doing around campus?\r\n\r\nAP: Obviously, as a school administrator, I am going to have the administrative part of that. I\u2019m going to be doing, you know, leading or just being a part of aspects of managing of the school, but you guys don\u2019t want to\u00a0hear about that, right. On the student side of it, you know, you\u2019re the dean, so you really want to interact with students, and it goes back to that, you know, finding the pulse at Paly and just getting to know what student \u2013 what does it mean to you guys, to be a student here, and how can I support and then help those efforts. So, the managerial side of it\u2019s very different than the student-centered part of it. Just try to be visible, you know, talk to you guys a lot, see what\u2019s on your mind.\r\n\r\nPV: If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be and why?\r\n\r\nAP: I\u2019ve always been fascinated with Easter Island, if you\u2019ve ever heard of that place. It\u2019s off of the coast of Peru. I don\u2019t know about living there though, that might be tough. That\u2019s a place I\u2019ve always been fascinated with and would want to check out, so maybe I\u2019d go with that.\u00a0 I\u2019d just hang out on Easter Island and be reflective, then I\u2019d come back to Palo Alto, right.\u00a0<em>(laughs).<\/em>\r\n\r\nPV: What would students be surprised to find in your refrigerator right now?\r\n\r\nAP: That\u2019s actually a really good question. I would say a homemade chicken broth, how\u2019s that sound? I\u2019m quite a cook and a chef, and I like to make stocks and broths, so that might be something that isn\u2019t a normal, everyday item.\r\n\r\nPV: What is something that has surprised you about Paly so far?\r\n\r\nAP: I think one thing that has surprised me a lot is the history actually that a lot of people have. A lot of teachers I\u2019ve talked to and parents during Back to School Night talk about when they went to Paly, especially the teachers, you know,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been here for 20 years!\u201d or \u201c30 years\u201d and \u201cI was a student here at Paly, too!\u201d Usually you might have a couple teachers, but it seems like a lot of the teachers I\u2019ve talked to have a past, which matters on how the school culture is built here.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with new Dean of Students Adam Paulson to learn how his time at Palo Alto High School is going so far.

The green features are very much a part of the building.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe green features will not only provide people with lovely environments, but they will also help the city save resources.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe library will save close to 50 percent, and 30 percent reduction in water use [due to its green features]\u201d Zittle said.\r\n\r\nAlthough it still is not open yet, the Mitchell Park Library has already excited Palo Altans.\r\n\r\n\"I think it is going to be a really great place for people to work and just spend some time with friends,\" freshman Tanay Krishna said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Keene, the library will be a place that the entire community can enjoy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe new Mitchell Park Library and Community Center will undoubtedly be a community jewel that will bring together multi-generations of Palo Altans for many years to come,\u201d Keene said.\r\n\r\nThe first event at the new library will be the Grand Opening scheduled for 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday, Dec. 6.\r\n\r\nAfterwards<a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1fKXTof\"> five weeks of events<\/a> targeted at different audiences will follow, according to Garcia.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere will be lots of activities and performances around the celebration of our opening,\u201d City of Palo Alto representative RuthAnn Garcia told The Paly Voice.\r\n\r\nThe library will be open until 8 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, until 6 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, and until 5 p.m. on Sundays.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"After almost three years of delay filled with construction and legal problems, the Mitchell Park Library is slated to open this November on Middlefield Road and will feature a variety of teen spaces and environmentally friendly features.","date":"2014-09-09 13:26:04","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_0783.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"15410":"game","27712":"game room","27710":"grand opening","8848":"Library","27709":"mitchell park","27711":"november","9663":"space","27177":"teen"}},{"id":73378,"title":"Season preview: Boys&#8217; water polo team looks for chemistry","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/09\/season-preview-boys-water-polo-team-looks-for-chemistry\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_73508\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"800\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/10686502_936996839650447_793134399_o.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-73508\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/10686502_936996839650447_793134399_o.jpg\" alt=\"Junior Winston Rosati takes a shot at practice.

However, the construction was delayed, which benefits the team, according to\u00a0Head Coach Brandon Johnson.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s an huge advantage [to still have the pool],\" Johnson said. \"It would have been quite difficult to drive to different pools every day to practice.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe water polo players share Johnson's sentiments about having a home pool this year.\r\n\r\n\u201cHaving the pool this season is massive for the team,\u201d junior driver Ryan Reed said. \u201cWe all thought that it would be unavailable, and the thought of having to practice away from home brought a negative feeling to many of my teammates.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe team will need to adapt after graduating 14 seniors last year. However, the Vikings are not expecting those departures to have a huge effect on their level of play.\r\n\r\n\u201cThough losing 14 is tough, this year's squad has the potential to exceed what was accomplished last year,\u201dsenior captain Lukas Novak said. \u201cThe biggest challenge will be seeing if the team can build the same chemistry it did last year.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Novak, Paly is not the only team that lost key players.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery team besides Gunn [High School] will be weaker than it was in the previous year,\u201d Novak said.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of the Paly team, according to both Reed and Novak, is the bench depth. Only seven remaining players were on full varsity last season.\r\n\r\nEven after losing so many players, the Vikings still have high goals for the upcoming season.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur goal is to make CCS like we did last year,\u201d Johnson said.\r\n\r\nHowever,\u00a0Novak says the team's ability to succeed will depend on its ability to play together, making the level of success hard to predict.\r\n\r\nThe team's first game will be held against Monta Vista High School at 6:45 p.m. on Sept. 18 at home.","excerpt":"After making it to the Central Coast Section semi-finals last year, the Palo Alto High School boys' water polo team (24-6, 10-2) is hoping to have another successful season.","date":"2014-09-09 13:08:23","author":"Samuel Desr\u00e9","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/10686502_936996839650447_793134399_o.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"9845":"boys water polo","27720":"brandon johnson","27719":"lucas novak","12045":"season preview","10248":"wopo"}},{"id":73469,"title":"Preview: Apple of my i(Phone 6)","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/08\/preview-apple-of-my-iphone-6\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_73513\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/photo-12.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-73513\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/photo-12.jpg\" alt=\"The iPhone family might soon have a new member.

Apple hasn\u2019t yet revealed what the countdown is for, but rumor has it that the iPhone 6 is being announced on said date.\r\n\r\nThe announcement will be held at 10\u00a0a.m. at the Flint Center in Cupertino, where the Mac was first announced 30 years ago, according to the news website\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirror.co.uk\/\">Mirror<\/a>.\r\n\r\nPopular technology sites such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/\">Macrumors<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.loopinsight.com\/\">The Loop<\/a> speculate that the new iPhone 6 will feature a power switch on the side (emulating the design of the Samsung Galaxy), and a better pixel display. The iPhone 6 will also have\u00a0a thinner and longer body than the current 4.87 inches height and the 2.31 inches width\u00a0of the iPhone 5. In addition Apple is said to be releasing the iPhone 6 in two\u00a0different sizes, according to several technology rumor sites. The iWatch is also said to be part of\u00a0the announcement on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nThe Apple stock (AAPL) has recently been in decline due to the fact that celebrities\u2019 iCloud accounts were hacked and confidential pictures were released, but the release of a new phone iPhone could end the downward trend.\r\n\r\nMany students are enthusiastic about the possible release of a new iPhone.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe iPhone 6 sounds awesome,\u201d junior Anant Marur said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it has this sapphire crystal screen \u2026 and I saw this video about it and its impossible to scratch. I always end up cracking my phones within a couple months of having them and I think it would be a very useful feature.\"\r\n\r\nJunior Jamie Har said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard it's bigger and the back is rounded.

The administration wants to provide the maximum amount of support for seniors who need help for college essays.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kellerman, the idea to reinvent the ERC has been around since before the addition of Tutorial. Already, the first shipment of furniture has been set up.\r\n\r\nAlong with the new donated library furniture, the Writing Center has been set up for collaboration and discussion. The Writing Center will also be furnished with desktop computers and printers according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re figuring out how to staff it, what we\u2019re going to put in it and what we\u2019re going to do with it,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cWe want to give the space back to students.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Parent Teacher Student Association is supportive of the Writing Center, and the administration is trying to fix the past claims that English teachers are not as accessible.

Diorio addressed the improved learning spaces, new teacher leadership positions and smaller class sizes.\r\n\r\nThe MAC and History\/Math building are two of several improvements to the Paly campus. The new additions received positive feedback from the public, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\nAccording to Diorio, the demolition of the gyms has been delayed due to budget issues. If the final price comes in at budget or below, the renovation process is set to start around Dec. 15. The library is also set to be renovated some time in the future.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the new features of the campus, there are new staff positions designed to help better the school community.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created some additional teacher leadership positions on campus called TOSAs \u2013 Teacher on Special Assignment,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cSome of our teacher leaders are focused on incorporating technology in the classrooms, helping and supporting teachers so that the lessons are more engaging.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother beneficial aspect is the smaller class sizes. Most freshmen and sophomore English courses have 19 to 20 students in each class, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe really wanted to lower those class size ratios so that our teachers are able to have more opportunities to personalize the learning for students and give them feedback in a more timely fashion,\u201d Diorio said.\r\n\r\nIn order to further enhance students\u2019 learning experiences, some of the classrooms have new furnishings.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen teachers are teaching \u2013 even if it\u2019s direct instruction \u2013 a lot of times, we find that [students] are moving maybe in the [new swivel] chairs, but their eyes are still focused on the teacher,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cSo just being able to move their body a little bit and that sensory motor integration is really important in terms of keeping them focused.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition to the presentation, Diorio held a Q&amp;A session for the parents. The PTSA also approved the new budget and bylaw changes at the meeting.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School Principal Kim Diorio is welcoming the 2014-15 school year with optimism and candor, according to comments she made at the first Parent Teacher Student Association General Association Meeting of the school year last night at Paly\u2019s Media Arts Center.

In previous years, students wishing to participate in the dance would audition, and from that group, five guys and five girls were chosen. This year, anyone will be allowed to sign up for their grade's dance, and the minimum number of participants will be five guys and five girls.
