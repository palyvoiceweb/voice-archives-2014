The Parade is the oldest children\u2019s parade in Northern California. This year\u2019s theme for the event is \u201cLet Me Be Your Neighbor,\u201d according to parade event planner Ali Williams.\r\n\r\nAll of the public middle and high schools of Palo Alto are performing in the parade. During the parade, multiple groups will be marching through the streets, including the Viking Pep Band from Palo Alto High School. The Viking Pep Band will be playing the song \u201cIn the Stone\u201d by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, according to band member and junior Andrew Lu.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got tons of spirit when it comes to playing outside,\u201d Lu said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do yells and cheers, and we have the signature kick during the drum cadence.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile Lu has participated in the Parade in past years for the marching band, he has also attended the event with his family when he was younger, according to Lu.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really great community event [and] brings everyone in town together,\u201d Lu said. \u201cThe groups are diverse, ranging from musicians to martial artists to middle schoolers who\u2019ve built go-carts at school.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring the parade, eight floats are going to compete for the Palo Alto Weekly Awards, along with clowns, stilt walkers, hula artists and other entertainers who will participate\u00a0in the parade. Different schools, youth groups, dance teams and sports teams will also march in the parade, according to Williams.\r\n\r\n\u201cNumerous preschool groups and elementary schools are joining the fun to show school pride,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe parade kicks off with the motorcycle police and ends with the shiny fire engine.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlong with those showing their spirit for the town, there will also be groups who are promoting their organization. The Palo Alto Children\u2019s Theater will be promoting their upcoming performance and the Humane Society will be walking through the parade, showcasing local pets in need. Representatives from the Palo Alto Historical Association will also be riding in the antique cars from the Museum of American Heritage to celebrate its one hundredth anniversary.\r\n\r\nThe parade will end at around noon\u00a0at Heritage Park, where the May Fete Faire will begin. At the park, all of the bands will perform as they arrive. The Faire will also have food trucks and games, according to Williams.\r\n\r\nWilliams stressed the importance of community building within the city.\r\n\r\n\u201c[The event is] a community event that celebrates all that we strive in Palo Alto,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that it\u2019s a place where people care and connect with each other to create a supportive community.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor more information on the event, click <a href=\"www.cityofpaloalto.org\/gov\/depts\/csd\/events\/parade.asp\">here<\/a>.<b>\u00a0<\/b>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto City will host its ninety-second annual May Fete Parade starting at 10 a.m. on Saturday, May 3 at University and Emerson Street.","date":"2014-05-01 14:46:36","author":"Julianna Heron","categories":["News"],"tags":{"15095":"fair","15099":"float","15097":"heritage","15098":"heritage park","15093":"may fete","15096":"museum","15094":"parade"}},{"id":71222,"title":"Slideshow: Underclassmen dominate powderpuff","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/01\/slideshow-underclassmen-dominate-powderpuff\/","content":"The annual powderpuff games started yesterday\u00a0with the seniors against the freshmen.

We have everything from a newspaper (The Campanile) to a foreign policy magazine (Agora) and everything in between. So what's next for Paly journalism? A radio show? \u00a0A news program via a complicated combination of carrier pigeons, smoke signals and morse code? Hint: it's the first one.\r\n\r\nPaly sophomores Zoe Limbrick, Maya Kandell and Esme Ablaza, along with the help of KZSU, Stanford's own radio channel, are working together to create Paly's very first audio publication.\r\n\r\nAccording to Limbrick, it was Kandell who first thought of the idea last semester while taking Beginning Journalism.\r\n\r\n\"The idea was brought up last semester sometime during Beginning Journalism, and then Maya [Kandell] contacted me shortly after to see if I was interested,\" Limbrick said.\r\n\r\nThe idea took off from there as the girls formed an official club with English teacher Lucy Fillipu as the advisor, as well as contacted KZSU.\r\n\r\n\"Six of us took a class to get air cleared at KZSU and they've been really supportive to help us get a show,\" Limbrick said.\r\n\r\nThe members of Radio Club have been working on straightening out the logistics of their new publication.\r\n\r\n\"We're going to loosely base our meetings off of a production cycle for a publication. We're going to work on story ideas and develop them during our meeting times,\" Limbrick said. \"Then we can conduct the actual interviews and do the initial editing outside of class. Our meetings will mostly be spent on creating the ideas and editing the stories.\"\r\n\r\nRadio Club's first broadcast was Sunday, April 13. Eventually, Limbrick and the others hope to have a fully-functioning publication to stand alongside the ranks of the rest of the Paly journalism program.\r\n\r\n\"We just want to produce a successful and professional show each week,\" Limbrick said.\r\n\r\nInterested in the club? Limbrick assures that it is not too late to sign up and participate.\r\n\r\n\"We're really welcoming for anyone who wants to join and you don't have to have any experience with radio or journalism,\" she said.","excerpt":"Paly sophomores Maya Kandell, Zoe Limbrick and Esme Ablaza, along with the help of KZSU, Stanford's own radio channel, are working together to create Paly's very first audio publication. \r\n","date":"2014-05-01 13:09:54","author":"Paige Esterly","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/Round-Radio.png","categories":["Features"],"tags":[]},{"id":71143,"title":"Voice Verbatim: What are your opinions on the Los Angeles Clippers&#8217; owner&#8217;s racist remarks?","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/01\/voice-verbatim-what-are-your-opinions-on-the-los-angeles-clippers-owners-racist-remarks\/","content":"Los Angeles Clippers' owner Donald Sterling recieved a lifetime ban from the National Basketball Association over racist remarks he made that were recently released to the public, according to the NBA.

Collectors rejoice with each new addition to their collections and take pride in showing off their finds.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_71172\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"336\"]<img class=\"wp-image-71172 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/alexrose1.png\" alt=\"alexrose1\" width=\"336\" height=\"448\" \/> Palo Alto High School sophomore Alex Rose proudly holds his prized shark fetus that started his interest in collecting animal taxidermies and also earned him a unique nickname. Throughout his life, Rose has been called multiple nicknames, including Rosy (for his rosy cheeks after Physical Education class), \u201cthe Costco guy\u201d (when he used to share his lunch in elementary school) and now is known as \u201cthe shark fetus guy.\u201d \u201cI like being the guy with all the nicknames,\u201d he said. Photo by Bethany Wong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nFor Palo Alto High School sophomore Alex Rose, the thrill comes from collecting objects that surprise people. Everything in his collection screams unusual, whether it be a prickly dead pufferfish, a puzzle box that seems to have no obvious opening, a miniature model of a Volkswagen car or even the seemingly ordinary ring around his finger.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, the ring, a woven tangle of sterling silver strands, looks like any other piece of jewelry. As Rose slides it off and performs a complicated algorithm, the ring detaches into eight separate hoops, revealing that this is actually a puzzle ring.\r\n\r\nAccording to Rose, his love for collecting oddities fits nicely with his love of meeting and befriending other people because items like the ring are perfect conversation starters.\r\n\r\n\u201cI collect oddities ... because I want people to remember me for owning them,\u201d Rose said.\r\n\r\nBy most standards, Rose\u2019s collection is indeed memorable. People who see his shelves are especially drawn to the display of animal taxidermies such as a frog, various animal brains and a unique shark fetus.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis friends ... think his shelf is super original and fun,\u201d Rose\u2019s girlfriend sophomore Hannah Subega said. \"There's always something there for his friends to look at.\u201d\r\n\r\nRose\u2019s interest for collecting animal preserves began when he received a shark fetus from Subega\u2019s younger brother, the previous owner. According to Subega, Rose was the ideal recipient of the shark fetus because he, unlike others, did not cringe at the sight of the unborn shark.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wasn't too surprised that Alex was glad to take it off my brother's hands,\u201d Subega said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Subega, the shark fetus used to be a Christmas gag gift that was regifted yearly, but \u201cluckily, we [Subega\u2019s family] found someone who actually wants it,\u201d Subega said.\r\n\r\nAlthough Rose now collects objects that can make people scream with disgust, when he first began collecting as an Escondido Elementary School student, Rose collected more ordinary items.\r\n\r\nIn elementary school, the pockets of his cargo pants held all the crystals, rocks, seashells, watches and coins he brought to school to show his friends, according to Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wore cargo pants ... because I could fill the pockets with stuff,\u201d Rose said.\r\n\r\nIf Rose could not carry all the knick-knacks in his pockets, he kept them at home in a box which he called his \u201cspecial things box.\u201d Originally, Rose said the box contained a small conglomeration of puzzles, such as uncommon Rubik\u2019s cubes. However, once his father began bringing home souvenirs from his business trips, the items found a new home in a larger container.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_71169\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"255\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/alexrose4.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-71169\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/alexrose4.png\" alt=\"alexrose4\" width=\"255\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a> Rose devotes twelve full shelves to his collection with separate shelves for his animal display, Rubik\u2019s cubes, puzzles and French antiques. His collection has outgrown the box he once used\u00a0\u2013\u00a0his \u201cspecial things box\" \u2013 and has become a striking ceiling-floor display. Photo by Bethany Wong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn eighth grade, Rose moved into a new bedroom that\u00a0featured a set of empty shelves on which he started displaying his favorite collections.\r\n\r\nWhen people complimented him on his shelf, Rose found that he enjoyed watching their reactions. Particularly, Rose said that he has always appreciated the way his eccentricities have earned him nicknames.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn fifth grade, people called me 'the Costco guy,'\u201d Rose said. \u201cI would hand out parts of my entire lunch [like Costco food samples] to my friends because it gave me attention.\u201d\r\n\r\nLong gone are the days of being jokingly associated with the food sample dispensers at Costco. Today, Rose is better known as a collector of oddities.\r\n\r\nOn a vacation in Paris during the summer of 2012, Rose\u2019s collection grew immensely. While the rest of his family wanted to shop for clothing, Rose preferred to scrounge through the antique shops. It was on this trip that he realized that accumulating oddities could actually become a rewarding hobby.\r\n\r\n\u201cI spent all my money on these outrageous antiques, such as pickle flavored toothpaste, an optical illusion that looks like a melting clock, puzzle boxes and a Frankenstein-like figurine with parts from a baby doll, a skull face, a crown and a rib cage, but it was so worth it,\u201d Rose said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Rose, his most prized piece from Paris is a crystal that shows the face of a clock from one side and looks like a compass from the other side.\r\n\r\nHaving depleted his spending money in Paris, Rose slowed down on his collecting spree once he returned to Palo Alto. Consequently, his family thought his collecting was just a temporary obsession, according to Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy family thought it was pretty amusing and didn\u2019t think I was serious,\u201d Rose said\r\n\r\nHowever, everything changed on Christmas Day of his freshman year when he opened a present from Subega\u2019s brother. Noticing Rose\u2019s fascination with trinkets like his puzzle ring, the brother gave Rose a bottle containing a shark fetus that still had its eyes covered with skin. Rose said this gift rekindled his passion for collecting.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_71171\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"261\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/alexrose2.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-71171\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/alexrose2.png\" alt=\"alexrose2\" width=\"261\" height=\"347\" \/><\/a> Rose\u2019s shark fetus, preserved in a glass bottle, rests on one of the shelves directly at eye level. The shark fetus, young enough to still have its eyes covered with skin, was given to Rose as a Christmas present. \u201cI\u2019ll always remember this gift as the beginning of an addiction,\u201d Rose said.

This program sparked Rose\u2019s passion for finding more animal parts that make people\u2019s eyes boggle with both gruesome interest and fascination, according to Rose. His collection now includes a diverse range of animal parts and preserves.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight: 800;\">\"<\/span>Here are my brains,\u201d Rose said, as he pointed to snake, rabbit, frog and bird brains sitting on a shelf.\r\n\r\nNowadays, Rose basks in the attention he gets from being known as the \u201cshark fetus guy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI like it when people are able to say, \u2018I remember Alex Rose. He\u2019s the guy with the shark fetus,\u2019\u201d Rose said.\r\n\r\nOver time, Rose realized that part of what inspires him to keep collecting is the satisfaction of learning the story behind each item.\r\n\r\nAccording to Rose, he likes being able to say, \u201cThis isn't only a ring, but a ring that is also a puzzle.\u201d\r\n\r\nRose delights in seeing the others\u2019 reactions when they find out that his ring is a more than what meets the eye. With eyes aglow, Rose explains the historical significance of puzzle rings. In medieval times, kings gave their wives the puzzle rings as wedding bands, according to Rose. If a wife cheated on her husband and wanted to remove the ring, the ring would fall apart and the king would know his wife had been disloyal.\r\n\r\n\u201cI enjoy surprising people with something they wouldn\u2019t expect,\u201d Rose said.\r\n\r\nDespite his interest in oddities, it is very unlikely for his collecting to become his future career, Rose said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_71170\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"289\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/alexrose3.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-71170 \" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/alexrose3.png\" alt=\"Rose\u2019s puzzle ring lies on a table showing its two different forms.

Regardless of what career path he chooses, Rose says he believes he will find a way to engage his appreciation of creativity and his love of the bizarre.\r\n\r\nRose carries his love for trinkets wherever he goes. He always has his daily essentials: his phone, his wallet and two to three trinkets that might be handy conversation starters.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never leave the house without full pockets,\u201d Rose said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"While many students engage in more \"normal\" hobbies, sophomore Alex Rose finds gratification in collecting oddball trinkets and novelties.","date":"2014-04-30 18:23:43","author":"Charles Yu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/Screen-Shot-2014-04-30-at-5.52.16-PM.png","categories":["Features","Spotlight"],"tags":{"15665":"alex rose","15667":"collection","15668":"collector","15670":"hannah subega","15669":"oddities","8944":"palo alto high school","15671":"personality profile","15666":"shark fetus guy","15672":"trinkets"}},{"id":71119,"title":"Missed opportunities send Vikings to fourth straight loss; Wildcats clinch division title","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/29\/missed-opportunities-send-vikings-to-fourth-straight-loss-wildcats-clinch-division-title\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_71122\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"618\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-71122\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/baseballrecaplosgatos.png\" alt=\"The Lone Viking: Right fielder Phil Lewis (#25) watches dolefully as Los Gatos celebrates it\u2019s De Anza division title following a 4-3 win in extra innings over Paly.

Photo by Josh Yuen.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDespite multiple chances to take the lead late in the game, the Palo Alto High School Vikings varsity baseball team (11-12, 5-5) fell once again to the Los Gatos Wildcats (20-4, 11-1) in extra innings by a score of 4-3\u00a0Saturday at Paly.\r\n\r\nThe Wildcats finished with 14 hits, scoring early in the second inning on Campbell Robertson\u2019s sacrifice fly. They battered Vikings starter Brian Kannappan in the fourth, when they took advantage of a throwing error by scoring two runs. While Los Gatos threatened to score in the later innings, pitchers Justin Hull and Chris Smith of the Vikings used key strikeouts and timely double plays to prevent the Wildcats from scoring any more.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings squandered several opportunities to score runs and win the game, but got on the scoreboard in the third when right fielder Phil Lewis hit a sharp ground-ball to the left of shortstop to score center fielder Bowen Gerould.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth inning, Lewis advanced Gerould to second on a single after Gerould chased starter Johnny Breidenthal by drawing a walk. A wild pitch set up both runners in scoring position, and Cleasby proceeded to score Gerould on an RBI single to center field. Cleasby later came around to score on a wild pitch by the new pitcher Bigge, tying the game at three apiece.\r\n\r\nThe sixth and seventh innings featured the Vikings getting runners on base, only to have Bigge pitch out of each jam and keep the game tied. With runners at second and third with just one out in the seventh, Bigge got catcher Austin Kron to ground-out softly, before striking out third baseman Noah Phillips.\r\n\r\nWhen Robertson, the Wildcats\u2019 no. 8 hitter in the lineup, stepped into the box to lead off the top of the eighth inning, his one goal was to get on base and represent the go-ahead run. Robertson, a senior, was yet to hit a home run on the season coming into the at-bat. The entire Wildcats\u2019 team had only two total coming into Saturday\u2019s game.\r\n\r\n\u201cI looked down at my third base coach and he said that [he] was just giving me the sign to get on base, so I was just trying to get on base,\u201d Robertson said.\r\n\r\nWith the wind blowing out towards left, Robertson ended up drilling Bicknell\u2019s fastball over the left field fence to give his team a one-run lead. Clapping his hands as he rounded third, the team rushed out of the dugout to greet him at home plate.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the eighth, I thought I made a good pitch and he got down to it and hit it out,\u201d Bicknell said, after taking the loss.\r\n\r\nPitcher Hunter Bigge closed out the game with a shut-down bottom of the eighth, securing his team the one-run victory. When Gerould was tagged out at first to end the game, the Wildcats poured onto the diamond once again, mobbing Bigge and crushing him under a dog-pile of ecstatic players. To the great dismay of the Vikings home crowd, the Wildcats had clinched the division title.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go out and celebrate a little, come back, get back to work, keep winning, and now we\u2019re looking forward to the league tournament now,\u201d said Robertson, who finished with a team-leading three RBI\u2019s.\r\n\r\nEven an extra fly-ball or a ball put into play past the pitcher was the difference between a Vikings win or loss. According to designated hitter Lawrence Han, the team played well against the division\u2019s top team, but ultimately made a few too many mistakes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we played pretty well but we just had a few bad breaks and there were some things that could have gone our way but didn\u2019t,\u201d Han said.\r\n\r\nWith just two games remaining on the schedule and a four-game losing streak, the Vikings find themselves sitting in fifth place, one spot outside the playoffs. They take on the Spartans of Mountain View next week, looking to get back to their winning ways.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Despite multiple chances to take the lead late in the game, the Palo Alto High School Vikings varsity baseball team (11-12, 5-5) fell once again <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/29\/missed-opportunities-send-vikings-to-fourth-straight-loss-wildcats-clinch-division-title\/#more-'\" class=\"more-link\">more &raquo;<\/a>","date":"2014-04-29 13:05:06","author":"Charles Yu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/baseballrecaplosgatos.png","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8410":"Baseball","15410":"game","9914":"los gatos","8953":"paly","9210":"vikings"}},{"id":71095,"title":"Paly students to compete in app showcase","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/26\/paly-students-to-compete-in-app-showcase\/","content":"<p>[caption id=\"attachment_71102\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"350\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/photo-2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-71102\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/photo-2.jpg\" alt=\"Students from Palo Alto High School are going to take part in the Applications Challenge Showcase finals tomorrow at the Palo Alto Arts Center.
