Her role as the mockingjay is to be the face of the rebellion against the capitol during the revolution. Reunited with her childhood friend Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), Katniss is reluctant to make any commitments to him because she is conflicted about her feelings for Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), her star-crossed lover and male District 12 tribute. Before the Hunger Games, a happy life with Gale was what Katniss always wanted, yet now she questions whether she really loves Peeta as he undergoes a transformation into President Snow's (Donald Sutherland) puppet.\r\n\r\nLawrence's emotional performance accurately portrays the traumatized Katniss and her reactions as they were in the books the \"Hunger Games\" movies are based on. Other characters also remain true to their developments in\u00a0\"Mockingjay\" by Suzanne Collins. Such as in the case of Gale, where more of his relationship with Katniss is highlighted, and of Finnick Odair (Sam Clafin), who has the largest transformation: swaying far from his over-confident and womanizing ways in the capital as observed in \"Catching Fire,\" to living a depressing life in District 13.\r\n\r\nHaymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson)\u00a0and Effie \u00a0Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) remain a dynamic duo, bringing laughs to the rather somber and violent plot. We see Haymitch\u00a0in complete withdrawal due to President Coin's (Julianne Moore) prohibition laws in District 13. Katniss's escort Effie loses some of her sparkle in her institutionalized military attire, yet remains her quirky self at heart. Without her elaborate makeup, wigs or highfalutin lifestyle, she makes the best of accessorizing what she does have.\r\n\r\nMoving away from the arena setting in which the first two movies in the series take place, the storyline unveils new sides of the story's protagonists as the uprising takes off. Exploring the revolts within the districts puts faces to the uprising's cause and casualties, which connects the audience to each character\u00a0and allows us to understand Panem, the futuristic, dystopian\u00a0world\u00a0of the novels, better.\r\n\r\n\"Mockingjay\" captures the spirit of the beginning of an uprising\u00a0by\u00a0offering a more somber tone. The film's mood is particularly captured in the haunting ballad, \"The Hanging Tree,\" sung by Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, which echoes the sadness of the loss of so many of Panem. These emotional moments tug at the audience's heartstrings, but the mood is often lightened by comedic breaks from fan-favorite characters Haymitch and\u00a0Effie.\r\n\r\nThe choice to split the book into two movies pays off as audiences are able to get an in-depth look into Panem's districts and the supporting characters, which can be particularly appreciated by fans of the series. Some characters such as Gale, who were hardly developed in previous films, are able to show more layers of their personalities and win over the audience's hearts.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_79224\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"206\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Effie-Stylin-in-13.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-79224\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Effie-Stylin-in-13.jpg\" alt=\"Effie (Elizabeth Banks), Katniss' escort from the capitol, goes through a makeup and wig withdrawal while living in militaristic District 13.

The lavish Capitol parties, clothing and food are replaced by drab military barracks, gray jumpsuits and cafeteria rations.\r\n\r\nThough the ending does seem slightly abrupt, we left with an overall excitement to await the final installment in the Hunger Games series as \"Mockingjay\u2013 Part 2\" is scheduled to be released on Nov. 20, 2015.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1<\/strong><\/em>\r\n\r\n<em><strong>123 minutes<\/strong><\/em> <em><strong>Release Date: Nov. 21, 2014<\/strong><\/em>\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Rated: PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, some disturbing images and thematic material <\/strong><\/em>\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Directed by Francis Lawrence <\/strong><\/em>\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Starring: Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson, Phillip Seymour-Hoffman and Elizabeth Banks <\/strong><\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The third installment in the captivating worldwide franchise The Hunger Games, \"Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1\" closely follows the book's plot that it is adapted from as it picks up where \"Catching Fire\" left off, following the traumatized Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) as she becomes the rebel's symbol: the mockingjay.

With this album, Swift is breaking free from her past image and is unveiling yet another layer of her talent, proving to the world that she is more than just a country girl in love with the idea of being in love.\r\n\r\nThe release of \u201c1989\u201d on Oct. 27 raised controversy due to her change in sound and appearance. Since entering the music industry at age 16, Swift has captivated her audiences with her charming and hopeful lyrics. In her first couple albums, she based her love songs largely on the ecstasy and heartbreak of puppy love. She channeled such emotions to create songs like \u201cLove Story,\u201d a track capturing the famous Romeo-and-Juliet story but with a happy ending, and \u201cTeardrops on My Guitar,\u201d in which she addresses the sorrow of unrequited love. As she grew older and matured, so did the scope of her songwriting. Her more recent love songs resemble thoughtful reflections of her relationships rather than diary-esque ballads.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_79238\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"365\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/image-1.jpeg\"><img class=\" wp-image-79238\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/image-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Swift\u2019s fifth studio album cover features a solemn, seagull sweater-wearing, half-covered Taylor Swift. \u201cEvery single element of this album has been called into question [by my label and management team],\u201d Swift said last week in an interview with TIME Magazine. \u201cI\u2019ve had to say \u201cNo, this is how we\u2019re doing it.\u201d \u2026 You have no idea how relieved I was [when the album sales numbers came out], because it was all on me if this didn\u2019t work.\u201d Photo by George Lu.\" width=\"365\" height=\"243\" \/><\/a> Swift\u2019s fifth studio album cover features a solemn, seagull sweater-wearing, half-covered Taylor Swift. \u201cEvery single element of this album has been called into question,\u201d Swift said last week in an interview with TIME Magazine. \u201cI\u2019ve had to say \u201cNo, this is how we\u2019re doing it.\u201d \u2026 You have no idea how relieved I was [when the album sales numbers came out], because it was all on me if this didn\u2019t work.\u201d Photo by George Lu.[\/caption]\u00a0\u201cIn the past, I\u2019ve written mostly about heartbreak or pain that was caused by someone else and felt by me,\u201d Swift said in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2014\/10\/31\/359827368\/anything-that-connects-a-conversation-with-taylor-swift\" target=\"_blank\">an interview with NPR<\/a>. \u201cOn this album [\"1989\"], I\u2019m writing about more complex relationships, where the blame is kind of split 50-50. I\u2019m writing about falling in love with a city, falling in love with a feeling rather than a person. [I\u2019ve learned that] lots of things are gray areas and complicated situations.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer song \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d on \u201c1989,\u201d for example, describes her new approach towards love: Instead of throwing everything she has into a relationship, she acknowledges how it is likely that the relationship will eventually end and that when it does, she hopes he\u2019ll remember her well. She notes that this mindset is \u201cnot anything close to the way I used to think about relationships.\u201d\r\n\r\nMusically, Swift has undergone a complete transition from country to pop. The country twang once evident in her older songs is nowhere to be found on the new album. Her change didn't come as a complete surprise. Songs like \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble\u201d and \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\u201d from her last album foreshadowed her eventual departure from country music. This is a significant transformation for her, in what she regards as her\u00a0\u201cfirst documented official pop album.\"\r\n\r\nAt first, we were unsure of her change in genres \u2014 Swift has done so well for so long within the country\/country-pop scene. Indeed, we still get nostalgic hearing her beautifully crafted songs about her past loves like \u201cBack to December\u201d or sweet tones like \u201cOur Song,\u201d but after hearing \u201cShake it Off\u201d the first time on the radio we realized that she is doing something greater. It is a movement that you don\u2019t need to rely on someone else for happiness or love, as she says. Although her country tunes will remain forever in our hearts \u2014 and trust us, they will never leave \u2014 we believe she has made the best possible choice for herself and for her listeners. Her sound has always been something genuine, something that comes straight from her (there isn\u2019t a single Taylor Swift song that she hasn\u2019t written or co-written). By staying true to herself and the direction she wants for her own music, Swift maintains the connection she\u2019s always had with her fans and opens the door for new fans.\r\n\r\n[soundcloud url=\"https:\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/104181511\" params=\"auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" iframe=\"true\" \/]\r\n\r\n<em>\u201cOur Song,\u201d the third single from Swift\u2019s eponymous debut album \u201cTaylor Swift,\u201d displays her country style of music.<\/em>\r\n\r\nHer classic country-pop songs have won her many Country Music Awards, including\u00a0Entertainer of the Year (for both 2009 and 2011) and\u00a0the prestigious Pinnacle Award. But now, as she matures and continues to succeed, her choice to escape the pigeonhole and expand her work beyond country music is appropriate and understandable.\r\n\r\nWith this information as a backdrop, our favorite songs featured on the \u201c1989\u201d album include the album\u2019s second single titled \u201cBlank Space\u201d and \u201cWildest Dreams.\u201d Her satirical approach to the media\u2019s perception of her in \u201cBlank Space\u201d serves as an emblem of this new era \u2014 one that is self-confident, liberating and fearless. She blatantly embraces her \u2018reputation\u2019 of being a serial dater and transforms it into her ninth No. 1 single, according to Billboard\u2019s Digital Songs chart. In the song and its music video, she assumes the role of her perceived persona and amplifies it with lyrics like \u201cGot a long list of ex-lovers\/They\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m insane.\u201d Lyrically, her songs are edgier, bolder, deeper, and arguably, better than ever.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/e-ORhEE9VVg\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n<em>Taylor Swift plays the role of a psychotic, boy-crazy person in the music video for her latest single \"Blank Space.\" \"I try to stay pretty self-aware about who I actually am and also what the media's depiction of me is,\" Swift said in the behind-the-scenes footage of the shoot. \"I was thinking a lot about that and I just thought 'You know what? What if I was that girl, what song would I write? And so I wrote \"Blank Space.\"\"<\/em>\r\n\r\nIn direct contrast, \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d shows a more vulnerable side of her new sound. Its Lana Del Rey-esque vibe and mesmerizingly bewitching vocals entice listeners and may appeal to music lovers of many genres; It\u2019s a perfect hybrid of Lorde\u2019s \u201cRoyals,\u201d John Legend\u2019s \u201cAll of Me\u201d and Calvin Harris\u2019s \u201cSummer.\u201d Despite Swift\u2019s grand entrance into the pop music scene, she still manages to distinguish herself from mainstream trends, creating not only a sound of her own but also reviving elements of '80s music.
