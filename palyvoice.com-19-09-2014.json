Hover over the circles to see the Beating the Odds and 2013 Top High School rankings. Map by Takaaki Sagawa using data from Newsweek.\r\n\r\nPrincipal Kim Diorio reacts positively to Palo Alto High School's recent rise in national rankings, yet sees room for improvement in decreasing the achievement gap.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto High School ranks 56th in Newsweek's\u00a02014\u00a0Top High Schools, climbing from 161st <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2013\/11\/12\/paly-climbs-up-national-high-school-rankings\/\">last year<\/a>. Paly also ranks 146th in Newsweek's new Beating the Odds ranking, which focuses\u00a0on performance of socio-economically disadvantaged students.\r\n\r\nDiorio is pleased with\u00a0Paly's boost in rankings.\r\n\r\n\"I'm extremely proud of our school, especially the students and staff,\" Diorio said. \"With over 20,000 public high schools in the United States, it is quite an honor to be selected in the top 100. \u00a0Of course, in my personal opinion, Paly ranks number one.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, Diorio also hopes to make progress in regards to the ranking controlling for poverty levels.\r\n\r\n\"It is no secret that there is a significant achievement gap and opportunity gap within our district,\" Diorio said. \"We are committed to improving learning for all students and hope to see this reflected in our rankings in year to come.\"\r\n\r\nThe\u00a0Top High School ranking\u00a0assesses achievement scores and college readiness based on a combination of\u00a0enrollment, graduation and attrition rates, ratio of counselors to students and weighted AP\/IB\/SAT\/ACT composite scores, with two new factors and different weights from the assessment of the previous year, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/methodology-newsweeks-top-high-school-rankings-268773\">according to Newsweek<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThis significant change in the methodology as well as lack of data for\u00a0other schools in the nation caused the jump in rankings for Paly, according to Business Development Associate at International Business Times Media Maria Bromberg.\r\n\r\n\"For our College Readiness analysis, we added two new factors and changed the weights,\" Bromberg said. \"It's important to note that while we used NCES (National Center for Educational Statistics) data for our threshold analysis, which allowed us to consider all the public high schools in the country, we could only include those schools who submitted survey data in our final rankings analysis. This could also account partially for the change in your school's rank for this year.\"\r\n\r\nThe Beating the Odds ranking assesses performance while taking into account of socio-economic statuses of students, according to Bromberg.\r\n\r\n\"We wanted to control for student poverty levels, which are known to impact students' performance in school, so we ran this separate analysis,\" Bromberg said. \"[We] measured performance while controlling for poverty levels, using the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch.\"\r\n\r\nOther ranked schools in the Bay Area include Henry M. Gunn High School (38), Leland High School (54), Los Altos High School (71), Mountain View High School (189), Homestead High School (403) and Cupertino High School (491), as shown on the map.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School places 56th in Newsweek's Top High School rankings, climbing from 161st last year.","date":"2014-09-18 20:15:40","author":"Takaaki Sagawa","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-16-at-11.49.36-PM.png","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"27738":"best","8751":"gunn","10749":"high school","10116":"leland","10028":"map","27736":"national","27735":"newsweek","27734":"ranking","27737":"state","27739":"top","27740":"two"}},{"id":74062,"title":"Police launch operation to increase biker awareness","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/18\/police-launch-operation-to-increase-biker-awareness\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_74103\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"578\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/anant-photo.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-74103\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/anant-photo.jpg\" alt=\"Anant Marur bikes out of the Palo Alto High School campus.

Wang says she attended 20 or more hours of dance classes a week, depending on rehearsals.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was most recently trained in [the style of] Vaganova, which is Russian, at City Ballet School in San Francisco,\u201d Wang said.\r\n\r\nKenneth Patsel, the director at City Ballet School of San Francisco, said he and the artistic director Galina Alexandrova first noticed Wang\u2019s talent when she attended a summer intensive five years ago at the age of 13.\r\n\r\n\u201cGalina \u00a0immediately spotted the potential in Jen and asked Jen, 'What do you want to do with ballet?'\u201d Patsel said. \u201cShe said, 'Of course I\u2019d like to be a professional dancer one day,' and Galina said, 'I think you have what it takes if you\u2019re trained properly.'\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_74033\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/10176142_10203142480593612_4450954726531116401_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-74033\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/10176142_10203142480593612_4450954726531116401_n.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Wang dances a pas de deux in the City Ballet of San Francisco's Spring Showcase 2011.

She was invited to go to New York as a finalist.\r\n\r\nAlexandrova had danced with Ashley Wheater, the director of the Joffrey Ballet, according to\u00a0Patsel. Using her connection, Alexandrova called Wheater to let him know that she had a spectacular student.\r\n\r\n\u201cGalina called up Ashley because she thought Jen was a very special student,\u201d Patsel said.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe did an audition with Ashley, and at the time it didn\u2019t look like he had any contracts,\u201d Patsel said. \u201cThree months went by from the time she auditioned. Apparently what was happening in the meantime was Ashley was negotiating with his board to get another dancer, and as it turned it out there was a dancer that left the company, thus leaving open one contract.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt that time, Wang had already been enrolled at Harvard. However, Harvard has a rule that if a student attends one semester, he or she may take an indefinite leave, according to Patsel.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey would\u2019ve normally started already in September, but Ashley, knowing that Jen needed to get that semester in the books, held the contract for Jen, which is almost unheard of, so that she could go to one semester and is going to start in January after they finish their Nutcracker,\u201d Patsel said.\r\n\r\nDespite a professional career being her dream, Wang still\u00a0feels\u00a0a little\u00a0nervous.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt Joffrey, I think I\u2019ll be intimidated because there will be quite a few older and way more experienced dancers than me,\u201d Wang said. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m not as experienced in contemporary, and Joffrey does a decent amount of that, so hopefully I\u2019ll be adaptable enough to fit in.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Wang is also looking forward to dancing with the Joffrey Ballet after years of hard work.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited to be dancing professionally because it\u2019s my dream and I loved performing,\u201d Wang said. \u201cI\u2019ll have the chance to probably work with a lot of really amazing and interesting people and will hopefully have more opportunities to perform, so I\u2019m really excited.\u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Recent Palo Alto High School graduate has signed with the Joffrey Ballet.

Photos by Jeanette Wong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWalking around the Palo Alto High School campus, one cannot help but notice the plethora of custom clothing sported by the students.\r\n\r\nFrom tie-dyeing T-shirts to designing clothing to <em>dye<\/em> for, as technology continues to advance, it has become easier than ever to make customized attire to promote and unify groups.\r\n\r\nSites such as DesignAShirt, Zazzle and CustomInk enable people to design and order products from virtually anywhere. The clothing is also relatively easy and fast to make.\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Anna Lu who designed the Paly Debate team attire, it takes around 20 minutes to create a design and around two weeks to ship.\r\nThe availability of the latest T-shirt making processes seems to attract students.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more readily available and more people have noticed it and have gotten on that bandwagon of [making custom clothing for their teams]... over the last 16 years,\u201d Paly receptionist Vallen Queen said.\r\n\r\nNew methods for creating attire has simplified the overall process.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would say that because of computers, we\u2019re now able to print [shirts] directly from the computers which means that it\u2019s a lot easier and cheaper to print small quantities of T-shirts,\u201d said Randy Samuels, owner of Big Frog Custom T-Shirts &amp; More of Mountain View. \u201cIn the past, most shirts were made with screen printing, which means you have to use films and... separate each color in your image. Every shirt needs to [be individually made] which means it can be more time-consuming.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Samuels, the invention of new technology streamlines the price and decreases the cost of the production of a single T-shirt. Additionally, the larger the quantity of the order, the cheaper the price will be, according to Samuels.\r\n\r\nThe advanced process of T-shirt making opens doors for more opportunities of creative expression.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I was in high school the only clothes I ever made were crazy tie-dye shirts,\u201d Paly librarian Rachel Kellerman said. \u201cI thought the shirts [my son\u2019s classmate made a few years ago] were very clever and creative. I like the fact that anyone with a design idea could sell a shirt.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhether it may be sports teams such as volleyball, cross country and cheer, or Paly clubs like YCS-Interact, Speech and Debate and Robotics, communities at Paly are taking advantage of the tools offered by custom wear.\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Bethany Wong, custom clothing is an effective way for students to express their interests.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the case of my cross country sweatshirt, [it has a] somewhat sassy phrase on the back,\u201d Wong said. \u201cI\u2019ve struck up conversations while wearing it as I went around Palo Alto because people mention how they were also on cross country in high school or that they have heard of our school.\u201d\r\n\r\nCustom clothing also brings a sense of unity to groups,according to Wong.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt [custom clothing] is an excellent way to exhibit team or club unity on campus,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThere's also a certain coolness factor because each piece of custom clothing might be \u2018limited edition\u2019 and reminds you of the group of people in that club or sport.\u201d\r\n\r\nCustom clothing, however, can also create separate groups of unified students according to math teacher Suzanne Antink.\r\n\r\n\u201cTeen club T-shirts overall became a sort of \u2018separating\u2019 or divisive style among groups of students \u2014 a sort of labeling when none was needed,\u201d Antink said. \u201cHowever, as some clubs compete outside of school, like [for] Robotics, Debate, Scioly or Math, club members like to have a unifying team shirts.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice asked a group of 25 sophomores, juniors and seniors at Paly and found that the students from this sample size had up to four pieces and spent up to $100 a year on custom wear.\r\n\r\nAs clubs and sports have started, students are excited to obtain their custom wear to represent the activities they participate in.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to order a Speech and Debate sweater this year,\u201d senior Dan Su said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to represent the team I love.\u201d","excerpt":"From tie-dyeing T-shirts to designing clothing to dye for, as technology continues to advance, it has become easier than ever to make customized attire to promote and unify groups.","date":"2014-09-17 19:00:34","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-16-at-3.41.19-PM.png","categories":["Features","Spotlight"],"tags":{"28779":"big frog","8596":"clothes","11711":"club day","11337":"clubs","28776":"custom","28775":"custom ink","28780":"shirts","28781":"swag","28777":"t-shirt","28778":"tshirt"}},{"id":74012,"title":"Freshman class decides Spirit Week theme","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/17\/freshman-class-decides-spirit-week-theme\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_74020\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"630\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/DSC_01361.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-74020\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/DSC_01361.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_0136\" width=\"630\" height=\"418\" \/><\/a> Freshman Vice President Claire Billman and Student Activities Director Matt Hall hold up the Spirit Week schedule from two\u00a0years ago to show the range of themes that previous grades have come up with.
