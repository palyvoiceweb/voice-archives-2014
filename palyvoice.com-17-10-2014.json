It's our second conference and first conference with new people,\u201d Nagar said. \u201cBut I'm also a little bit nervous because the Stanford conference is so big and people come from other countries to participate.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor MUN, the Stanford conference will be a place to continue building experience, according to MUN member, sophomore Tara Madhav.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am nervous, but I'm mainly just excited, because SMUNC [last year\u2019s Stanford conference] was my first conference ever and now I'm going back with a lot more experience\u201d Madhav said.\r\n\r\nMembers will also use this conference as a place to try out new types of committees, according to Madhav.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis [the Stanford conference] is my first crisis committee,\u201d Madhav said. \u201cIn crisis committees, you aren't re-enacting the UN; you're re-enacting a body or council from a certain time and place in history.

To compensate for the loss, students have also gained 27 spaces in the Churchill Avenue lot.\r\n\r\nAccording to Berkson, the combined construction of both the Big Gym and the Performing Arts Center will cause a net loss of 112 parking spaces.\r\n\r\nThe limited parking may make drivers more reckless and pose a larger danger to bikers.\r\n\r\n\u201cI leave for school every morning at 7:30 a.m.,\u201d senior Ellen Shuan said. \u201cYet I still have limited parking options.

This event donates money to\u00a0the Side-Out Foundation, a non-profit organization that\u00a0advocates breast cancer awareness through volleyball.\r\n\r\nPaly has collaborated with Los Altos for the last two\u00a0years, and has raised over $4,600 total through the previous annual events, according to the press release.\r\n\r\nSenior outside hitter\u00a0Hayley Poore said that there are multiple ways that Dig Pink raises money.\r\n\r\n\"<span style=\"color: #3e454c;\">We have a bake sale during the game and sell baked goods, water, and t-shirts,\" Poore said. \"All the money we raise from that goes to the Side-Out foundation. We also collect cash and check donations at the match, or people can donate directly to the Side-Out foundation online.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nThis year, the coordinators decided to fund-raise a little differently.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #3e454c;\">\"We used to count digs and people could make a pledge to donate per dig, but most people preferred to just pick a specific amount of money to donate,\" Poore said. \"This year, we are not going to be tying donations to the number of digs.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nWhile this\u00a0match\u00a0is scored like\u00a0a normal game, it's much more exciting, according to Poore.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #3e454c;\">\"It is a regular league match, but the gym is decorated in pink, students perform the National Anthem, in between sets the Los Altos dance team performs, and the game will be filmed by Cal-Hi Sports,\" Poore said.<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to sophomore setter\u00a0Julie Chandler, the teams have fun with this event by dressing up.\r\n\r\n\"We wear the Dig Pink shirts and pink ribbons, and so does the other team,\" Chandler said.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the important charity\u00a0event, the game will be exciting as\u00a0Los Altos is one of the strongest teams in the league, according to\u00a0Poore. Although their last meeting resulted in a Paly loss, Chandler hopes to fight hard this game.\r\n\r\n\"Last time against Los Altos we had a slow start, which made it harder for us to win,\" Chandler said. \"If we can have a strong start and play as a team, we can compete with them and do well.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Chandler, Los Altos senior Carmen Annevelink will be a huge threat. She\u00a0committed to UC Berkeley\u00a0in November of her junior year to play volleyball, according to Annevelink.\r\n\r\n\"A key player to look out for on the other team is Carmen, their big outside hitter,\" Chandler said. \"Getting a good block up on her will be really important.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the strong opposing team, Poore expresses her excitement for the Dig Pink match.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #3e454c;\">\"It's a great way to help a good cause,\" Poore said. \"Lots of people show up and it's fun to see everyone in pink.\"\r\n<\/span>\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"https:\/\/www.side-out.org\/cb\/campaigns\/campaign\/9095\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a> to donate to Paly's campaign.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School girls' volleyball is playing Los Altos High School in the third annual Dig Pink event to raise breast cancer awareness and money for research.","date":"2014-10-15 19:31:33","author":"Amy Leung","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/digpink1.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"29491":"breast cancer awareness","30048":"carmen annevelink","8642":"Dig Pink","8725":"fundraiser","11244":"girls volleyball","30049":"hayley poore","30050":"julie chandler","9849":"los altos"}},{"id":76174,"title":"Voice of the Week: James Franco","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/15\/voice-of-the-week-james-franco\/","content":"<i>The Paly Voice and the <a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/palyradio%20\">Paly\u00a0Radio Club<\/a> met up with celebrity alumnus James Franco to discuss his murals on Paly's student center, his love for academic environments and whether he would prefer bananas for feet or for hands.<\/i>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_76211\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"445\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Screen-Shot-2014-10-14-at-6.25.08-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-76211\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Screen-Shot-2014-10-14-at-6.25.08-PM.png\" alt=\"The mural painted by actor and alumnus James Franco is inspired by photos from Palo Alto High School\u2019s 1993 yearbook, when Franco was a freshman.

Photo by Adele Bloch.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice\/Paly Radio Club: What prompted you to paint this mural?\r\n\r\nJames Franco: I have done a lot of work with writing and artwork and even films that are inspired by teenagers or coming of age, and because I went to Paly, this is my main source of reference for this time. I just liked them [the photos in his freshman yearbook\u00a0in\u00a01993] because when they were in the yearbook, they were just photos of people going to school.\u00a0But as time goes by, at least for me, my high school years became\u00a0this weird mythical place.\u00a0When I was a teenager, it seemed like I felt so much; everything seemed so important and there was so much pressure of all kinds and I was experiencing certain things for the first time. And so, the paintings, for me at least, captured that. Even though they're just paintings of a football game or a volleyball game or The Campanile, to me it evokes the feelings of that time. ...\u00a0Instead of rebuilding a part of Paly, I could show the art work that was inspired by Paly at Paly.\r\n\r\nRC: Did your high school and your youth tend to have a big influence on your work?\r\n\r\nJF: It [high school] continues to inspire me. When I focus in\u00a0on high school, the characters for me are much more alive in some ways than older characters. When you get older, you get a little bit more set in your ways. But when you're young, your life is still ahead of you. You haven't made all your most serious decisions about life yet and you're discovering things for the time. I just find that those kind of characters are the most alive when you work with them.\r\n\r\nRC: What's it like coming back to Paly and seeing everything again?\r\n\r\nJF: I love school, and I love being around academic environments. Woj [journalism teacher Esther Wojcicki]\u00a0and I are even talking about a class that I might teach here in a year [at Paly]. I love it here. When I was in high school, I had a bit of a hard time, but I was just figuring out who I was. But now I love coming back.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_76215\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"393\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Screen-Shot-2014-10-14-at-6.31.07-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-76215\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Screen-Shot-2014-10-14-at-6.31.07-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-10-14 at 6.31.07 PM\" width=\"393\" height=\"383\" \/><\/a> Franco signs his name and class graduation date on the mural that he painted on the outside of the Student Center. \u201cWe wanted to tie it [the mural] in as something that was cool to look at and something that people could feel proud to have as a part of their campus,\u201d Franco\u2019s art studio manager Anna Kooris said.[\/caption]RC: What first got you interested in being an actor and being a part of the\u00a0entertainment industry?\r\n\r\nJF: I've always loved movies and theater. When I was at Paly, I'd drive to San Francisco to see ACT [American Conservatory Theatre] productions. I'd see David Stratton\u00a0do the \"Tempest\" there, and I think I saw \"Phantom of the Opera\" there, and \"Chicago\" and stuff like that. That was the only thing that was offered around here. And I've loved it for a long time, but I was very shy. And then in my senior year, I joined the drama class and I did two plays. ... Then I went to UCLA. Once I was in LA and I saw that everyone was trying to get into the movies, so I decided to give it a shot.\r\n\r\nRC: Did any specific teacher help shape your dreams and plans at Paly?\r\n\r\nJF: Since Paly, I've had many very influential teachers. I've been very lucky and I've got to go to a lot of great great schools, so I've had tons of great professors. At Paly, Woj is a big influence.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_76207\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"430\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9080.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-76207\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9080.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_9080\" width=\"430\" height=\"286\" \/><\/a> Paly alumnus Franco and journalism teacher Esther Wojcicki pose for a selfie in honor of the completed murals.

So I went to acting school, and my parents said they wouldn't support me if I didn't go to college. So, I then went and worked in the cafeteria at UCLA even though I wasn't a student and then I worked at McDonalds. And then I got a Pizza Hut commercial \u2013 it was a Super Bowl commercial, so it paid pretty well, and it was a CG [computer generated] image of Elvis dancing in the Pizza Hut. And so it starts off with a bunch of guys in the parking lot saying, \"Hey, you heard they're selling the new deep-dish pizza at Pizza Hut, and Elvis is serving it?\" And they're like, \"No way, they don't have a deep-dish pizza.\" And then it cuts to Elvis serving a deep-dish pizza. And that was it, and then I could support myself from my acting from that point on. (Watch this commercial <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WIryAZFVKtw\">here<\/a>.)\r\n\r\nRC: Would you rather have banana hands or banana feet?\r\n\r\nJF: Oh, tricky. Like slip all over the place kind of thing?\r\n\r\nRC: No, if you just had five bananas right here on your hand jutting out?\r\n\r\nJF: But they'd break really fast.\r\n\r\nRC: I'd just like to think that they'd be ready for action as a hand or as a foot.\r\n\r\nJF:\u00a0I think I use my hands more than my feet, so I'd have to do banana feet. If I got hungry, I can just eat my feet.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_76221\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"416\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9051.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-76221\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9051.jpg\" alt=\"Two helpers hang up Franco's painting of a water polo player in 1993.

What that means is that you are becoming aware of your readers. You aren't just writing for a grade \u2013 you're writing to get people to read it. That creates a completely different kind of relationship between you and your work, and it's on the way of\u00a0creating\u00a0a professional relationship with your work. So any time, if you want advice, any time\u00a0you can have that situation or start to become aware of what it is you're doing or what you will be doing when you write professionally and how you're connecting to your audience is really valuable.\r\n\r\n<em>Franco is holding an art show and film premiere\u00a0for the grand\u00a0<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #000000;\">opening of the Media Arts Center from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 18.

Because the\u00a0SAT is planned to change for the Class of 2016, the practice tests are no longer being given.\r\n\r\nInstead, freshmen and sophomores now have two seminars with their teacher advisers\u00a0about career exploration and planning. Guidance counselor Charles Taylor says the goal this year was to try and find seminars that kept the theme of college and career awareness, in the place of\u00a0taking practice tests.\r\n\r\nTaylor says that the senior workshops have been very successful in the past and they wanted to continue with them. However, Ann Deggelman, coordinator of the TA program, says a financial literacy session has been added to the senior workshops based on surveys from seniors in the past.\u00a0Financial Literacy will teach students about checkbooks and bank accounts and other life skills, Deggelman says.\r\n\r\nFor seniors, some workshops will be held during both sessions and you can chose which workshops would be most beneficial.\u00a0College Application Help is a general question session for seniors who still are confused on certain parts of the application process. The UC and CSU session goes over the differences in these two applications and the best way to go about these applications. College Essay help has group review and teacher review of college essays for a variety of opinions in order to obtain the best college essay.\r\n\r\nSome workshops\u00a0are only offered during one session such as the new financial literacy workshop. Other one session workshops are helping with college interviews or figuring out if community college is the right option.\r\n\r\nMany seniors have been debating the importance of College and Career Awareness Day, but some are certain of its significance.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would like to go to the College and Career [Awareness]\u00a0Day because I think it will make me more aware of the college process,\u201d senior Jack Brook said.\r\n\r\nThe full list of events for tomorrow can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/paly.net\/news\/college-and-career-awareness-day-october-15\">here<\/a>.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School students will participate in their respective grades' college preparatory-related activities for College and Career Awareness Day tomorrow, with changes from last year as freshmen and sophomores will now attend college and career exploration pathways.","date":"2014-10-14 21:52:35","author":"Alex Merkle-Raymond","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9984.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"9678":"career","8604":"college","29990":"college and career awareness","29217":"psat"}},{"id":76160,"title":"PTSA to host social justice presentation","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/14\/ptsa-to-host-social-justice-presentation\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_76164\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"583\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/photo2.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-76164\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/photo2.jpg\" alt=\"Students watch Global Lives videos after school in the MAC.
