Each playwright is then assigned a theme and has to write a short play involving all the actors before 8 a.m. the next morning. After the script is finished, the actors rehearse all day for the performance at 8 p.m. on Dec. 20.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe best part [of the event] is that it\u2019s tradition for alumni to participate,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cEveryone has so much fun spending time with old friends doing theatre for an entire day. Even though there\u2019s always a time crunch and it seems like there\u2019s no way that the plays are going to work, everything somehow magically comes together.\"\r\n\r\nParticipants of the event echo the thoughts of Nguyen.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a lot of fun, and it\u2019s a good opportunity for people that don\u2019t really do theatre a lot to get involved,\u201d senior Katherine Craig said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hectic and crazy, but the end result is always hilarious and worth it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThose who want to sign up should contact <a href=\"mailto:hannah.nguyen@ymail.com\">Nguyen<\/a> as soon as possible. For those who simply want to enjoy a night of theatre, tickets are $10 for adults and $7 for seniors and students.
