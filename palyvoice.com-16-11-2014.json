So we tend to get head-to-head with them in multiple sports.\"\r\n\r\nGiven this rivalry, Dennis believes that Paly has what it takes to win.\r\n\r\n\"I think Homestead is tough competition, but I think that we definitely have the ability to beat them because we've been working really hard in practice and we've had a lot of improvement since last time we played Homestead,\" Dennis said. \"Since then, we've been going up\u00a0and becoming a lot stronger and a lot more consistent.\"\r\n\r\nPassarello also has high hopes for an intense game.\r\n\r\n\"It'll be a tough match, but if we play well, which I know we can, it'll be a really fun game because there'll be a lot of competition,\" Passarello said.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls' volleyball team (4-8, 19-11) will play Homestead High School (10-2, 22-13) in the Central Coast Section playoffs at 7 p.m. today at Homestead.","date":"2014-11-15 16:32:53","author":"Amy Leung","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/LRP_0819.jpg","categories":["Sports","Uncategorized"],"tags":{"8568":"CCS","32706":"dennis","8734":"girls","32704":"homestead","32705":"passarello","9888":"quarterfinals","9216":"volleyball"}},{"id":78627,"title":"Liveblog: Football at Saratoga","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/11\/14\/liveblog-football-at-saratoga\/","content":"<em>Check back at 7 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 14 as the Palo Alto High School football team (3-6, 2-3) travels to south to take on the Saratoga High School Falcons (4-5, 2-3) for its final regular season game of the season.\u00a0<\/em>\r\n\r\n[liveblog]","excerpt":"Check back at 7 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 14 as the Palo Alto High School football team (3-6, 2-3) travels to south to take on the Saratoga High School Falcons (4-5, 2-3) for its final regular season game of the season.

There are weekly tastings of tea flavors and additions to make the store seem more communal. The syrups and almond jelly are made from scratch, and almost everything is organic, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bobaguys.com\" target=\"_blank\">Boba Guys\u00a0website<\/a>.\r\n\r\nI ordered a drink with almond milk because Boba Guys is one of the few places I\u2019ve been to that has a dairy free option, and I wanted to take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nThe server was generous with the pearls, which were very chewy and flavorful and did not disintegrate. The tea flavor was very strong, but the drink was incredibly sweet. At certain points, some sips would be almost unbearably sweet if the syrup wasn\u2019t completely mixed in.\r\n\r\nA downfall was the slow service, but Boba Guys does call the drinks the \"Slow Bar\" in warning. Also, the drink was served with a snap-on\u00a0lid. Some people may not understand the importance of this, but without a vacuum sealed lid, it is impossible to shake the drink into a perfect mixture with no too-sweet spots.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Boba Delight<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<address style=\"font-weight: inherit;\"><span style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;\">528 Larkin St.,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;\">San Francisco<\/span>,\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;\">94102<\/span><\/address>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_76781\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9884.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-76781 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9884.jpg\" alt=\"Boba Delight was very sweet and watery.

It\u2019s relatively new, and you can purchase glass bottles to bring in again for a discount. Boba Delight also has a stamping rewards system that gives you a free drink after you buy 10 drinks.\r\n\r\nI personally will\u00a0not return and do not recommend that anyone try it. The service was very slow, and once I finally received my drink, I was less than impressed.\r\n\r\nThe drink was incredibly sweet and super syrupy. At the time time, it seemed like they used water instead of milk because it was so thin and not at all creamy. I could not mix the drink to see if it was just mixed poorly because it had a snap-on\u00a0lid.\r\n\r\nThe pearls were very soft and would often clog up the straw. They started to disintegrate quickly and would leave a tapioca pearl residue on the sides of the cup. Everything seemed very artificial, and I could barely tell if they gave me the flavor I asked for.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Quickly<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<em>300 Walnut St.,\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: inherit;\">Redwood City<\/span>,\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: inherit;\">Calif.,<\/span>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: inherit;\">94063<\/span><\/em>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_76779\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9888.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-76779\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9888.jpg\" alt=\"Quickly was not very flavorful but the service was very fast and the sizes are large.

I would personally call it the McDonald\u2019s of pearl milk tea places. I have had Quickly on multiple occasions, and I have never been particularly impressed. This location was no exception.\r\n\r\nIt has very fast service, large cup sizes and many options for mix-ins. I chose the usual tapioca pearls which were large and very chewy. The pearls did not leave remnants in the cup, but coated the inner straw and mouth. In general, the drink was sweet, very milky and not very flavorful.\r\n\r\nThe straws were not wrapped, which I have never seen before and made me a little suspicious. Quickly uses the FIVESTARS reward card system and is cash only. I would say that if you can find a flavor you like, go because it\u2019s cheap, but be aware that it\u2019s not very good either.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Plentea<\/strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_76782\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9927.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-76782 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9927.jpg\" alt=\"Plentea did not have many flavor options but what it did have was delicious.

All drinks are served in cool glass containers, and the store will give you a 10 percent discount if brought back. The bottles also have a lid for transportation and reusability.\r\n\r\nThere was a line out the door that\u00a0was very slow moving, but once you\u2019ve ordered, the drinks come quickly. There are few flavor options, but there are fruit drinks, smoothies, teas and many combinations of all of these.\r\n\r\nThe tea was very flavorful with large, soft pearls. The drink was very creamy and because there was no flavoring, there was no mixing required for a perfectly smooth drink. The texture was even throughout the bottle, which I very much appreciated.\r\n\r\n<i>Please leave a comment to suggest Pearl Milk Tea places you would like reviewed.\u00a0<\/i>","excerpt":"Staff writer Alex Merkle-Raymond takes the PMT challenge to San Francisco where she experiences the best and worst PMT she's ever had.

In a competition for the second open seat and with the provisional ballots uncounted, Crystal-Foster trailed 199 votes behind Godfrey at last count, and the \"uncounted ballots are unlikely to change the outcome,\" Crystal-Foster said in an email to her campaign staff and supporters.\r\n\r\nHere is the full text of her email announcement:\r\n\r\n\"We've all been watching the living lesson that every vote truly counts in our democracy. At this point, the county has recorded all remaining vote-by-mail ballots, and there are only a few thousand uncounted provisional ballots remaining county-wide. Ken Dauber has secured one school board seat, and Terry Godfrey is ahead of me by 199 votes for the second seat. The uncounted ballots are unlikely to change the outcome, so I offer my sincere congratulations to Ken and Terry as the new members of our school board. Both Terry and Ken will be staunch advocates for our students, and I wish them both the best. I have great regard for the talent and dedication that all the candidates brought to this race. My best to Gina Dalma and Jay Cabrera, as well, who share a commitment to education and will, I'm confident, continue their good work on behalf of students. I look forward to continuing my service to the schools and our students, and will do so in a spirit of collaboration with all our school leaders.\r\n\r\n\"I am grateful for the opportunity to have spent these past six months discussing the future of Palo Alto\u2019s schools with so many in our community. I continue to be energized by you, by the opportunities before us, and by the ambition of our new superintendent. To those of you who walked, called, endorsed, created, gave, wrote, informed, and inspired over this campaign -- many, many thanks. We created a network of positive thinkers who care about education that will continue long after the final ballots are counted.\r\n\r\n\"I am privileged to have been surrounded and supported by so many wonderful friends and neighbors in this journey.

I want to see a strong work week.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings and Falcons kick off at 7 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 14, at Saratoga High School.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School football team (3-6, 2-3) will look to finish out its regular season with a critical victory when it faces the Saratoga High School Falcons (4-5, 2-3) this Friday on the road with potential Central Coast Section playoff implications at stake.

Nearly 1,000 downloads have been recorded as of last week from the App store, according to \"Method to Madness\" programmer junior Matt Seligson.\r\n\r\n\"The most surprising part of these sales was the fact that people from such a wide variety of countries downloaded the app,\" said sophomore programmer and President of the iOS club Brian Tracy.\u00a0\"The only things I know about Uzbekistan are that it is somewhere in Asia, and that someone there appreciates Method to Madness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Method to Madness is a fun game, and I keep playing it because the board changes every time and you can keep trying to get a bigger score,\" junior\u00a0Zach Segal said.\r\n\r\nBoth Seligson and Tracy were shocked after receiving that amount of positive feedback. Their app is rated five stars out of five on the App Store.\r\n\r\n\"[The] explosion in the first week took us by surprise,\" Tracy said.\"We had expected a couple of downloads from people at Paly, but not the near 1,000 that we got.\"\r\n\r\nSeligson and Tracy say they have put many hours into their project.\r\n\r\n\"The app was a work in progress throughout most of the summer,\" Tracy said. \"A couple several-hour sprints were required to put the final touches on the app during the school year.\"\r\n\r\nAnother member of iOS club also launched an app this past week. The vice president of iOS club, sophomore Naveen Pai, developed \"Master-Plan,\" an app that has for goal to help students keep track of their assignments, \"Master-Plan\" can also be downloaded from the App Store.","excerpt":"A gaming app was launched by two students Palo Alto High School student last month.","date":"2014-11-11 18:01:45","author":"Samuel Desr\u00e9","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Screen-Shot-2014-10-22-at-3.14.09-PM.png","categories":["Entertainment"],"tags":{"29479":"App Store","15394":"apps","32581":"brian tracy","15410":"game","32580":"ios club","12054":"matt seligson","11983":"Matthew Seligson","32579":"method to madness"}}]
