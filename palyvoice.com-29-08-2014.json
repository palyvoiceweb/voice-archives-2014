Although Gelataio is slightly off the beaten path of University Avenue, its modern flair and unique spin on gelato makes it worth the extra trek to the end of Lytton Avenue near the train station.\r\n\r\nGelataio, which opened Aug. 14, blends together traditional gelato from Italy with fresh California ingredients.\u00a0 The atmosphere also offers a blended vibe. The mixture of Italian chatter from behind the counter and the high-tempo, artsy pop music playing in the background created an inviting and cool ambiance.\r\n\r\nRanging from traditional gelato to chocolate-dipped gelato bars and take-home pints, Gelataio will satisfy any sweet tooth. In order to try a range of tates we tried the Piccolino and four different flavors of gelato in Piccolo-sized cups: mint and choco-chip, straciatella, chocolate and cajeta (Mexican caramel). All the flavors were very creamy and fresh tasting, but not overbearingly sweet.\r\n\r\n\"What I intend to do is make my gelatos with an Italian passion and California fresh products that we have here,\" store founder and gelatiere Christianne Mares said. Mares grew up making gelato in Germany for friends and family, but two years ago she took classes and started making it professionally.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_72868\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"273\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-9.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-72868\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-9.jpg\" alt=\"Gelataio displays its various offerings of gelato flavors at the front of the store.

Photo by Maddy Jones.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAlthough some items are slightly pricey, each cup comes with at least two flavors and is expertly presented with a chocolate dipped wafer.\u00a0Even the small, Piccolo ($3.99), is plenty to eat. For the extra hungry, the Regular ($4.99) offers three flavors and the Grande ($5.99), which offers five flavors, is coming soon.\r\n\r\nThe highlight of the dessert was the Piccolino ($3.15). It was a mini three-inch hazelnut ice cream cone dipped in chocolate and topped with crushed hazelnuts. It was a perfect marriage of Nutella and a Drumstick in a little three-inch cone.\r\n\r\nAnother reason to love this store is the punch card Gelataio hands to you after you pay where after you order seven different times you get a free gelato of any size.\r\n\r\nOverall, Gelataio is definitely worth it to go to. The flavors are rich and the gelato is creamy.\r\n\r\nGelataio is open everyday. Sunday to Wednesday it is open from 12 a.m. to 9 p.m. and from Thursday to Saturday it is open from 12 p.m. to 10 p.m.","excerpt":"Although slightly off the beaten path of University Ave, Gelataio's

night. Screenshot by Takaaki Sagawa.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education announced plans earlier tonight to improve education, school environment and academic assistance for the 2014-15 school year during a school board meeting at the PAUSD district office.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting, the board presented five goals to the community, all with an emphasis on improving the education and the environment of\u00a0Palo Alto schools through governance and communication.\r\n\r\nThe new PAUSD superintendent Max McGee said the board\u00a0intends to focus on the overall improvement of\u00a0curricula.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s one [goal] about consistency, high quality and fairness in curriculum, instruction and assessment,\u201d McGee said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard this [complaint] from students, and I\u2019ve only been here three weeks.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe board also\u00a0aims to prioritize an action plan to provide individualized academic assistance through equitable opportunities for all students who are preparing\u00a0for post-high school life.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe want to make sure that all of our students have nothing but the best education we can provide,\u201d McGee said. \u201cThis goes for resources and assistance. \u2026 We want all our students to think college-bound and beyond college.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the board wants to ensure a safe environment for all enrolled in PAUSD, according to Associate Superintendent Charles Young.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe that the initiative that we will be focusing our efforts on this year [is] fostering personal development in health of students through social, emotional, behavioral and physical supports and services,\u201d Young said.\r\n\r\nMcGee also stressed the importance of the district\u2019s unity while still\u00a0promoting individual school growth.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe big general themes are balancing a district mission and vision but still giving schools the opportunity to innovate, to incubate ideas,\u201d McGee said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a balance. It\u2019s like helping a collective community versus a collection of communities.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn order to more clearly communicate with residents, the district plans to ask the community directly of its concerns.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re holding a lot of outreach events to understand and listen,\u201d McGee said. \u201cWe want to hear what\u2019s on your mind, so we\u2019re holding ourselves accountable for that.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe district also intends to promote transparency to keep everyone informed on all of its progress.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe second measurable is to create a baseline of positive, neutral and negative media reports related to the district,\u201d McGee said. \u201cMy experience is that generally, organizations that are seen as open, responsible, proactive and forthright have fewer negative reports. We want to create this baseline so we can look month after month, year after year to see how we\u2019re doing.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe goals presented earlier\u00a0tonight will be reviewed periodically throughout the school year by the school board, according to McGee.\r\n\r\n\u201cEach of those [goals] have some measures and deliverables,\u201d McGee said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be bringing these goals back to the board quarterly to review to make sure we get the job done.\u201d","excerpt":"The Board of Education discussed measures and deliverables for the 2014-15 academic year at the first school board meeting.","date":"2014-08-26 23:45:07","author":"Takaaki Sagawa","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/boardmeeting8-26.png","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"23909":"2014-2015","23906":"academic year","23907":"assistance","11799":"Board of Education","8604":"college","23932":"first meeting","23905":"goals","10043":"meeting","9069":"School Board","9129":"student","9152":"teachers","23910":"transparency","23908":"tutor"}},{"id":72874,"title":"Freshman class elections start Aug. 27, vote at paly.io\/vote2018","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/08\/26\/freshman-class-elections-start-aug-27-vote-at-paly-iovote2018\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2014-08-26 21:29:28","author":"Charles Yu","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":72812,"title":"Season preview: Girls&#8217; volleyball welcomes new head coach","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/08\/26\/season-preview-girls-volleyball-welcomes-new-head-coach\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_72814\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/DSC_0115.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-72814\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/DSC_0115.jpg\" alt=\"Desiderio discusses goals for the day\u2019s practice with the team.

Photo by Amy Leung.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPalo Alto High School girls\u2019 volleyball team is preparing for its first preseason game on Sept. 9 as it adapts to a different style with a new head coach.\r\n\r\nLast season, the team lost head coach Dave Winn and graduated seniors Keri Gee, Lauren Kerr, Sarah Limb and Becca Raffel.\r\n\r\nAfter coaching eight successful seasons and clinching two state championships, Winn stepped down from his position when he was offered the varsity coach position at Mountain View High School in his hometown.\r\n\r\nThe girls\u2019 volleyball team went 25-11 overall and 8-4 in league last year. Its season ended at the Norcal Semifinals with a loss to Granite Bay, the team that would eventually go on to win the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF)\u00a0State Championship.\r\n\r\n\u201cDave did a lot for the Paly volleyball program, so I know we\u2019re all thankful for him and we\u2019ll miss him a lot,\u201d junior middle blocker Claire Dennis said.\r\n\r\nThe new head coach, Daniele Desiderio, has over two decades of playing experience. He was the second youngest player in history to join the professional Italian National League at age 16. After a successful career on the team, Desiderio said he went on to play in the International League, playing for seven different countries including Japan, Spain and Iran.\r\n\r\nWith this extensive amount of experience on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Desiderio has a lot to bring to Paly\u2019s volleyball team, according to Dennis.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a different type of coach than we\u2019ve had before,\u201d Dennis said. \u201cHe\u2019s talked a lot about small details and improving those. \u2026 I think that\u2019s a very important thing to go from a good player to a great player.\u201d\r\n\r\nBecause Desiderio recognizes that this is a transition year, he decided to take on a relatively larger team of 18 players versus last year's already large 16 members.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe had so many seniors and juniors and players already on this team,\u201d Desiderio said. \u201cThese players were part of this program, and I didn\u2019t want to be the one putting them outside.\u201d\r\n\r\nHowever, Desiderio hopes to take younger rising varsity athletes and use the freshmen and junior varsity teams to train them to play with the medley of styles that Desiderio learned throughout his professional career.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would like to have more freshmen on the team in the future,\u201d Desiderio said. \u201cI will be responsible for all of the program and will try to fix fundamentals so [players] will arrive at the varsity level and it will be easy for them to play and be inside our system.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition, Desiderio intends to have all the girls improve through the season by giving everyone the opportunity to play.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the players that were in the tryouts, they will play this season,\u201d Desiderio said. \u201cSome on varsity, some of them somewhere else. We plan to have them play more.\"\r\n\r\nAfter just five days of tryouts, Desiderio already sees potential in the varsity team.\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw a lot of them have a lot of great effort and try to apply everything I coach them,\u201d Desiderio said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we will have a good season overall because the players show me a great attitude and effort.\u201d\r\n\r\nVarsity assistant coach Jekara Wilson-Gaines also noted the team\u2019s improvement under Desiderio\u2019s instruction.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m most looking forward to seeing how the girls thrive under his guidance,\u201d Wilson-Gaines said. \u201cI feel a lot of players, if not all, will improve and have fun while doing so.\u201d\r\n\r\nDennis expressed similar sentiments about the upcoming season.\r\n\r\n\u201c[Senior] Jade [Schoenberger] is going to be a big contributor, and [senior] Anna [Dukovic] as well,\u201d Dennis said. \u201c[Sophomore] Jess [Lee] is really exciting because she had to step up a lot last year and I know that she\u2019s ready for it this year.\u201d\r\n\r\nSenior outside hitter Anna Dukovic has an outlook of friendly competition on the situation.\r\n\r\n\u201cI look forward to playing Dave\u2019s [Mountain View] team,\u201d Dukovic said, \u201cand hopefully beating them.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will play their first preseason away game at 6:30 p.m. on Sept. 9 at Leland High School.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School's girls' volleyball team prepares to enter the season under the training of a new head coach.","date":"2014-08-26 19:23:20","author":"Amy Leung","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/DSC_0115.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":{"12701":"2014","23661":"daniele","23662":"desiderio","8693":"Fall","12043":"new coach","9216":"volleyball"}},{"id":72859,"title":"Parking passes being sold to seniors in Auditor&#8217;s Office, enforcement begins Sept. 24","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/08\/26\/parking-passes-being-sold-to-seniors-in-auditors-office-enforcement-begins-sept-24\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2014-08-26 18:50:47","author":"Maddy Jones","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":72852,"title":"Alternative schedule Friday, Aug. 29, school ends early with no first or seventh period","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/08\/26\/alternative-schedule-friday-aug-29-school-ends-early-with-no-first-or-seventh-period\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2014-08-26 18:50:27","author":"Maddy Jones","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":72848,"title":"Community service hours for transcripts and President&#8217;s Award due Aug. 29","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/08\/26\/community-service-hours-for-transcripts-and-presidents-award-due-aug-29\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2014-08-26 17:34:32","author":"Lizzie Chun","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":{"8636":"deadline","23889":"president's award","23890":"volunteer hours"}},{"id":72841,"title":"Verbatim: Freshmen reactions to Paly","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/08\/26\/verbatim-freshmen-reactions-to-paly\/","content":"The Paly Voice asks the Freshman Class of 2018 about its first impressions of Palo Alto High School.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/wWsEPYit78M\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"The Paly Voice asks the Freshman Class of 2018 about its first impressions of Palo Alto High School.","date":"2014-08-26 16:19:04","author":"Julia Asin","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Screen-Shot-2014-08-26-at-4.18.52-PM.png","categories":["Spotlight","Verbatims"],"tags":{"24174":"2018","24173":"class of 2018","8721":"freshmen","24172":"freshmen reactions","24175":"julia asin","9201":"verbatim"}}]
