Hull, a team captain, braved through several rough hits and instigated a few solid drives for the Vikings. Head coach Jake Halas credits Hull's work ethic and attitude every game to the quarterback switch.\r\n\r\n\"<span style=\"color: #3e454c;\">He's a gamer,\" Halas said after the loss. \"That's why he's in there at quarterback. We made the [quarterback] move because on game day, that kid shows up. Number five shows up to play.\"\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_74966\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"960\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/974670_762226977168696_1559327935_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-74966\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/974670_762226977168696_1559327935_n.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the Palo Alto High School football team observe the game action from the home sideline.

Despite watching the Chieftains take full control of the game early in the fourth quarter, Puckett is proud of the way that the team stuck together and kept playing until the end.\r\n\r\n\"Our team kept fighting and pushing,\" Puckett said. \"We just kept fighting and tried to make something happen, something positive. I can say that we worked more as a team tonight, something that we've been struggling do.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chieftains offense, highlighted by sophomore phenom tailback Emilio Martinez, struck for four overpowering touchdowns in the first half. Martinez accounted for three of the team's five touchdowns, sprinting into the end zone in a variety of ways, including a screen pass and an inside run.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings turned the ball over to the Chieftains four times, which continuously crushed any hopes of a Vikings rally. Despite the team's continuous struggles, Hull feels that the team is making improvements and is playing better than what the score might indicate.\r\n\r\n\"We played hard,\" Hull said. \"The first half was closer than what the scoreboard said. The second half we played pretty well actually. We battled and that's all you can really ask for.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will host the Wilcox High School Chargers (2-1, 0-0) for their first division game of the season at 7 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 3 at Hod Ray Field.","excerpt":"Despite starting a different quarterback, the Palo Alto High School football team (1-3, 0-0) was unable to snap out of a two-game scoring drought, falling to the Palma High School Chieftains (4-0, 0-0) 35-7 on Friday night.

The local duo consists of Palo Alto High School seniors Sally Wang and Fabian Gardu\u00f1o, who joined forces after working on solo projects previously.\r\n\r\n\"The Striped Sea EP\" debuted on Sept. 18 performing selections from the album during lunch on the Paly Quad that day.\r\n\r\nDespite having\u00a0formed only recently, the duo has been successful, releasing two singles,\u201cEvaporate\u201d and \u201cSurvive,\u201d which are both featured on its EP. \"Evaporate\" has received 1,145 listens on Soundcloud and \"Survive\" has received 980 listens so far, with the views increasing every day. They are currently in the top 20 charts under electronic music for <a href=\"http:\/\/paperislands.bandcamp.com\/\">bandcamp<\/a>, an online music store that allows consumers to set their own price. Paper Islands has also performed at The Palo Alto Teen Arts Council's open mic nights, Battle of the Bands and other local gigs around the Bay Area.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_74673\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"326\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/10370561_1010207329005614_470440216_n1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-74673\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/10370561_1010207329005614_470440216_n1.jpg\" alt=\"Wang and Gardu\u00f1o pose for a selfie while listening to friends who are in the band &quot;Forever For a Second.&quot;\" width=\"326\" height=\"440\" \/><\/a> Wang and Gardu\u00f1o show their excitement by posing for a selfie while listening to friends who are in the band \"Forever For a Second.\" Photo by Sally Wang.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTheir music is a combination of indie and electronic, also known as electro indie.\r\n\r\nThe first song titled \u201c&amp;\u201d provides listeners with a simple melody with vocals by Wang. The lyrics send the message to be yourself and not care about what others think of you. \"&amp;\" captures the essence of a short and sweet song, but with a big message.\r\n\r\nThe album continues, with the next song, \u201ci miss you.\u201d The song is a personal story of Paper Islands that they wanted to share with the public. The track uniquely incorporates a real-life breakup phone call between a girl leaving for college and her then-boyfriend and emphasizes the obstacles of having a long-distance relationship.\r\n\r\nThe conversation, according to Gardu\u00f1o, was recorded through a phone conference with permission. It's full of emotion and all about the true feelings one gets when one has to let go to someone special in one's life. The song is enhanced by sounds of the airport at the beginning and end of the song along with the phone conversation. Wang does an excellent job vocally, showcasing the emotions of desperation and sadness through her voice, to capture and embody what one feels during a breakup.\r\n\r\nThe final song, titled \u201cSurvive\u201d was written and produced with Paly senior Will Kast. \u201cSurvive\u201d is the perfect ending to the duo\u2019s EP album. The hook is sampled from the National Nuclear Emergency Alert, which one would hear if the United States was under nuclear attack. To dramatize the song, a beat instantly drops once the message is over, and Wang's vocals comes in with the beat. Even though the EP was released only a week ago, I've already found myself singing and humming along to the catchy tune.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_74563\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/photo-11.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-74563\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/photo-11.png\" alt=\"Paper Islands performs on Sept. 5 at the Lucie Stern Community Center put on by Teen Art's Council.

Wang adds that the ocean's constant changes inspire the duo's music.\r\n\r\nThe EP can be played and downloaded above from the bandcamp, with a\u00a0set-your-own price policy.

But with the recent rise of cancer-based movies and TV shows, I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of what Hollywood thinks it\u2019s like to live with cancer:\r\n\r\nYou live a pretty decent life. You get diagnosed with cancer. You feel like your life is over. You suddenly appreciate life so much more now that you know your days are numbered. You die a tragic, beautiful death.\r\n\r\nThe summer blockbuster \u201cThe Fault In Our Stars,\u201d based on the soul-wrenching young-adult novel by John Green, spotlighted the topic of cancer and became the trailblazer for several other shows revolving around cancer and similar life threatening diseases.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed the ups and downs of the Hazel-Gus timeline in \u201cTFIOS;\" it\u2019s the unrealistic portrayal of the disease from the shows that succeed it that confounds me.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s great that mainstream entertainment is bringing attention to such a serious issue, but the border-line glamorization of cancer is getting out of hand.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the new Fox dramedy \u201cRed Band Society,\u201d which premiered at 9 p.m. last week, gives viewers a questionable image of life with serious medical issues. This new series tells the story of a diverse group of teen hospital patients bound together by the common trait of being seriously ill. (\u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d much?)\r\n\r\nThese teens try to make the best of their not-so-glamorous life at the hospital, smoking pot in deserted rooms and buying alcohol underage. In one scene of the pilot episode, they throw a \u201cgoodbye party\u201d for the leg of a surgery-bound teen, practically singing Kumbaya in a circle on the hospital rooftop. Granted, there are a few touching moments, like when the one-legged main character tearfully reminisces his presurgery life or when the sharp-tongued nurse shows compassion by ordering pizza for one of the kids. (It\u2019s a long story.) For the most part, \u201cRed Band Society\u201d is a heart-warming series but there is definitely room for improvement in terms of the plot line.\r\n\r\nWhat this show \u2014 like a couple others \u2014 fails to touch on is the painful side of cancer. Shows focus on clich\u00e9 aspects such as love triangles, friend drama and other basic components of a hit teen story instead of bringing light to the reality of the situation. The colossal range of emotions, the sporadic feelings of nausea, the hair\/weight\/appetite loss, the seemingly endless tests and the side effects of whatever medication a patient needs to take may all be a part of a cancer patient\u2019s life \u2014 a part that is not included in the said TV show. While it\u2019s okay that producers hold an optimistic view, the show\u2019s misleading take on life with cancer raises eyebrows.\r\n\r\nAs the narrator of \u201cRed Band Society\u201d so brilliantly says, \u201cEverybody thinks that when you go to a hospital, life stops. But it\u2019s just the opposite \u2014 life starts.\u201d The TV show makes it seem like having a serious illness is a great life changing experience. It gives the perception that having cancer is a blessing in disguise, a way for people to truly understand the meaning of life. People need to understand that their \u201clife\u201d can \u201cstart\u201d even without being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness and being chained to a hospital bed.\r\n\r\nCancer is not beautiful. Cancer is not the ID that lets you get past the bouncer of the exclusive learn-the-value-of-life club. Cancer should not be romanticized. And most of all, the gravity of cancer should not be downplayed simply for the sake of appealing to teenagers across the nation.","excerpt":"A summer blockbuster pioneers a new genre in mainstream entertainment.

The library will also include an upper level mezzanine and collaboration spaces for both students and teachers.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kellerman, the library design was developed after extensive research to provide for future demands.\r\n\r\n\"We've been working on the designs for a couple of years,\" Kellerman said. \"It's very well researched. We've looked at many libraries all the way from high school to colleges to public libraries to make sure we have everything we need not necessarily now, but moving forward into the future.\"\r\n\r\nThe board will also discuss the proposed project budget and the authorization to proceed with schematic design, which the Bond Program plans to propose\u00a0in December 2014 or January 2015. The overall expense of this project adds up to $9.35 million, which will come from the Strongs Schools Bond passed in June 2008.\r\n\r\nAccording to Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson, the library is set to move into the 700 building before\u00a0the planned 13 month-long construction begins in June 2016.\r\n\r\n\"Most likely, the library will be moved to the 700 building,\" Berkson\u00a0said. \"We'll have to wait for the gym to be done because PE [physical education] is moving there now.\"\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_74584\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"437\"]<img class=\"wp-image-74584\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-5.02.31-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-09-23 at 5.02.31 PM\" width=\"437\" height=\"254\" \/> Guidance Office and the College and Career Center will move to the 500 building, allowing space for a Meeting Room and Alumni Room respectively in the Tower Building, according to the board meeting agenda.\u00a0Illustration\u00a0courtesy of DLM Architecture.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAccording to Berkson, the library construction is dependent on the gym construction because of the limited substitute space. This poses a threat to the planned construction time as the recent delay in the gym construction has pushed back its proposed finishing date to Dec. 2016.\r\n\r\nThe board will vote to approve the conceptual design, budget and contract for the schematic design in the next meeting on Oct. 7 at the PAUSD office.","excerpt":"The Strong Schools Bond Program will present revised conceptual designs for the 500 building, including a new library and collaboration spaces.","date":"2014-09-23 18:44:31","author":"Takaaki Sagawa","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-20-at-9.51.58-PM.png","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"29186":"500 building","8458":"administration","21437":"bond","29193":"budget","8558":"campus","9678":"career","8570":"center","8604":"college","29189":"conceptual","8616":"construction","29188":"design","8748":"Guidance","29191":"hub","8848":"Library","25038":"McGee","29190":"mezzanine","8912":"new","29192":"office","9681":"PLAN","11895":"plans","9021":"quad","29187":"renovation","9069":"School Board","9177":"tower building"}},{"id":74598,"title":"Deadline for dropping a class Oct. 9","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/23\/deadline-for-dropping-a-class-oct-9\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2014-09-23 17:47:04","author":"Lizzie Chun","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":{"8589":"class","8636":"deadline","29215":"drop","8658":"dropping"}},{"id":74529,"title":"Liveblog: Paly girls&#8217; volleyball takes on rival in first game of season","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/23\/live-blog-paly-girls-volleyball-takes-on-rival-in-first-game-of-season\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_74618\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/photo4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-74618\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/photo4.jpg\" alt=\"Palo Alto High School girls' volleyball team cheers in their huddle right before their first league game against rival, Gunn High School.
