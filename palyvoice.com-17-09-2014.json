Senior Noah Hashmi made it to the final rounds last year and current debate coach Alex Carter of the Class of 2012 won it his junior year.\r\n\r\n\u201cI definitely could not have won without the help of our coach Matt DeLateur,\u201d Lu said. \u00a0\u201cHe helped me a lot in adapting to parent judges and making my arguments sound more persuasive, so I'm really grateful to be able to work with him as well as all of the other phenomenal coaches on our team.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe topic of the debate was organ procurement from the deceased.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe debated about whether or not the government and society should assume that individuals want to donate their organs after they die,\u201d Lu said.\r\n\r\nLu was sick for most of the tournament and had to sleep in between rounds. Despite this, she was the only competitor to go undefeated.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I saw that my name was first on the list and that I was the only undefeated debater, I honestly could not believe that it was true,\u201d Lu said. \u201cThat was by far my favorite moment during the tournament.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was the first major tournament of the debate season and Lu\u2019s second major victory, having gone undefeated at the Catholic Forensics League 3 tournament last year.\r\n\r\n\"I think my biggest takeaway from this tournament is an increased confidence in my debating ability,\" Lu said. \"I was definitely an underdog sophomore year, as most sophomores are, so now I feel like I have to ability to compete against the best of the best.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div class=\"_3ry4\" data-reactid=\".1y.$mid=11410757608069=2614843293c0c8ea136.2:1\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"A Palo Alto High School junior went undefeated at the Saint Francis High School debate tournament this weekend, going 6-0 through the preliminary rounds and 3-0 in the final round.\r\n","date":"2014-09-16 14:05:03","author":"Lizzie Chun","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/10346523_846914058672168_8296186943263715459_n-22.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"28579":"alex carter","28577":"anna lu","28580":"anna nakai","8638":"debate","28581":"gabi rossner","10542":"paly debate","28578":"st francis debate tournament"}},{"id":73610,"title":"Call-in show with Supt. to air next month","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/16\/call-in-show-with-supt-to-air-next-month\/","content":"The Palo Alto Unified School District will host a live call-in TV broadcast featuring Supt.

Photo by Saba Moussavian.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nConstruction near the Haymarket Theater has forced students at Palo Alto High School to make changes to their routines, some of which involve their morning afternoon commute to and from school. Biking, a popular choice of transportation for many Paly students, has become a challenge this year due to the absence of efficient bike cages. One cage, in particular, has caused distress among many Paly students for a variety of reasons.\r\n\r\nThe bike cage in question is adjacent to Embarcadero Road, across from Town and Country. Along with the Media Arts Center, the cage is new to the Paly campus this year, but unlike the new buildings, it has not made a good first impression on students. The cage has three parallel racks all enclosed in a very small fenced area. The proximity of the racks makes it impossible for people to maneuver in between the rows. More often than not, people are forced to carry their bikes up and over other bikes while attempting to move through the sea of hastily locked bikes. Students that are running late often find no space to park their bikes, with the front (and only) entrance to the cage swarmed by an overabundance of bikes.\r\n\r\nForcing students to physically lift their bikes up and over other bikes (and people) also puts them at risk of injury to themselves and damage to surrounding bikes. Last year, the Paly campus <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2013\/10\/08\/opinion-we-want-bike-rack-city\/\" target=\"_blank\">had difficulties with a lack of bike space as well<\/a>. Recent construction seems to have aggravated the problem.\r\n\r\nTo try and solve this dilemma, administration should\u00a0consider removing one of the bike racks or opening the back of the cage. This, however, only solves part of the problem. Traffic flow through both entrances will still be impossibly tight. Numerous students have complained about the bike cage and the complications that have arisen.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe bikes are way too close together and people park so that [others] can\u2019t actually get to the other bike racks,\u201d junior Emma Raney said. \"They just block you from locking your bike and I usually have to lock my bike to the outside of the cage.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome students\u00a0have succumbed to simply parking their bikes outside of the cage. With construction blocking the front entrance to the school, bikers along Embarcadero have been rerouted to the bike path parallel to the train tracks, where they then turn and bike near the General Education building. Once they reach the bike cage, they are faced with the decision of whether or not to try and push their bike through the crowded entrance or simply lock their bike on the side.\r\n\r\nSophomore Gregory Jerian agreed with Raney, citing the entrance of the bike cage as his biggest concern.\r\n\r\n\u201cPeople\u00a0can\u2019t get their bikes in,\u201d Jerian said. \u201c[They] have to lift their bike over all the other bikes.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe feel that there are a sundry of ways to solve the problem. If one of the racks were to be removed or if faculty unlocked the back gate, parking bikes would no longer be the challenging task it is now. Additionally, if the bike cage was expanded to the point where the proximity of the bike racks was big enough for bikes to squeeze by, it would make the process much less time consuming. An elementary part of bike cages is the physical spaces. If there is not enough room in a bike cage for the bikes to squeeze past each other, it is not fulfilling its basic job.\r\n\r\nBiking is the most efficient and environmentally friendly form of transportation for most Paly students. The fact that students are discouraged from biking because of the unkempt bike cage is a travesty. With a couple fixes, students and bikers in particular would feel less vexed about their bikes.","excerpt":"Biking, a popular choice of transportation for many Paly students, has become a challenge this year due to the absence of efficient bike cages.

Every first day of the month there is a new tea launch that becomes a part of the permanent collection, Hamel said.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cOur tea wall is ever-expanding,\u201d Hamel said.<\/p>\r\n<p>Not only does David's Tea have a\u00a0large selection of\u00a0teas, it also offers various ways\u00a0to\u00a0make each kind of tea. Each tea flavor can be made hot, iced, in a pot, latte or tea pop.<\/p>\r\n<p>Unique to David's Tea, a tea pop is made by taking the desired tea flavor and adding Soda Stream, carbonated filtered water, for sparkling effect.\u00a0I chose to try the\u00a0Big Apple tea pop ($4), which was a great substitute\u00a0for soda, as it was fizzy but had much less sugar. When I took my first sip, I could sense an\u00a0apple flavor that felt cool to my throat,\u00a0with a\u00a0subtle sweet aftertaste. But a fair\u00a0warning: if the tea is not finished before the ice melts, the drink severely waters down the already\u00a0light flavors.<\/p>\r\n<p>Buddha\u2019s blend ($3.50), which Hamel said is one of the most popular teas, is composed of jasmine pearls, white hibiscus blossoms and natural and artificial flavoring, according to David\u2019s Tea <a title=\"David's Tea\" href=\"http:\/\/www.davidstea.com\/?&amp;currid=usd&amp;LN=EN\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a>. The tea had a slightly brown coloring and a smell that made me feel as though I was walking through a garden full of chrysanthemum flowers. The tea was flavorful, and held a light bitter aftertaste. The outside of the cup was nice and warm, making it a perfect drink for a winter day.<\/p>\r\n<p>The iced Pumpkin Chai Latte ($4.50), which\u00a0its\u00a0website said is composed of black tea, cinnamon, cloves, lemon peel, carrots, caramel bits and pumpkin candies, was mixed with milk and Agave, a natural sweetener. The light brown drink was slightly bitter and very rich. Although the flavor was great, the smell brought me back to the holiday season, and to be honest, the aroma was probably better than the drink itself.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"_5wd4 _1nc7 direction_ltr _5yt9\" data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223\">\r\n<div class=\"_5wd9\" data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0\">\r\n<div class=\"_5wde\" data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0\">\r\n<div class=\"_5wdf _5w1r\" style=\"color: #3e454c;\" data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\"><span class=\"_5yl5\" data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0.0\">David's Tea has relatively similar prices to Teavana, a\u00a0competitor tea chain\u00a0in the area, but because David's Tea sells its items in a different fashion, it's hard to make a final judgment call on which store\u00a0offers better prices.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">\r\n<div data-reactid=\".11.$mid=11410404591756=2a67400a1e43d0bf223.2:0.0.0.0\">At David's Tea, each tea takes about one to five minutes to make, depending on the kind of tea.

Paulson takes the place of Craig Tuana, who is now an assistant principal at Lynbrook High School.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice: Describe yourself in three words.\r\n\r\nAdam Paulson: I would say I am dedicated, passionate and funny. That\u2019s what would describe me. I have a good sense of humor.\r\n\r\nTPV: What are your first impressions of Paly?\r\n\r\nAP: Well, you know, I think it seems like a really great place to go to high school. Students, the facilities and the grounds \u2013 they\u2019re just tremendous. And from all the students and faculty I\u2019ve already talked to, it just seems like a place that has a lot of pride and school spirit, so I\u2019m excited about that.\r\n\r\nPV: What are you looking forward to this year at Paly?\r\n\r\nAP: I think mostly just trying to find that pulse. I\u2019m very much into school culture and the way students are thinking and feeling, really just trying to talk with as many students and student organizations and athletic organizations as I can so that I can get a pulse for what Paly is about and what the school culture is all about, you know? And try and find ways where I can interject and collaborate with students and teachers.\r\n\r\nPV: If you were a crayon, what color would you be, and why?\r\n\r\nAP: Trying to think back to some of those funky Crayola colors. Maybe a magenta-something that doesn\u2019t \u2014 that has a unique identity \u2013 is it blue? Is it green? I\u2019m a musician myself, too, so I like to express myself, and magenta is I think one of those mysterious colors.\r\n\r\nPV: What instruments do you play?\r\n\r\nAP: Anything with strings, you know,\u00a0guitar, bass.\r\n\r\nPV: Who\u2019s your favorite artist?\r\n\r\nAP: Now that would have to be a whole other interview, right? <em>(laughs).\u00a0<\/em>You know, I play anything from classical to heavy metal. Elvis Costello is one of my favorite musicians, just to name one.\r\n\r\nPV: As \"dean of students,\" what are students likely to see you doing around campus?\r\n\r\nAP: Obviously, as a school administrator, I am going to have the administrative part of that. I\u2019m going to be doing, you know, leading or just being a part of aspects of managing of the school, but you guys don\u2019t want to\u00a0hear about that, right. On the student side of it, you know, you\u2019re the dean, so you really want to interact with students, and it goes back to that, you know, finding the pulse at Paly and just getting to know what student \u2013 what does it mean to you guys, to be a student here, and how can I support and then help those efforts. So, the managerial side of it\u2019s very different than the student-centered part of it. Just try to be visible, you know, talk to you guys a lot, see what\u2019s on your mind.\r\n\r\nPV: If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be and why?\r\n\r\nAP: I\u2019ve always been fascinated with Easter Island, if you\u2019ve ever heard of that place. It\u2019s off of the coast of Peru. I don\u2019t know about living there though, that might be tough. That\u2019s a place I\u2019ve always been fascinated with and would want to check out, so maybe I\u2019d go with that.\u00a0 I\u2019d just hang out on Easter Island and be reflective, then I\u2019d come back to Palo Alto, right.\u00a0<em>(laughs).<\/em>\r\n\r\nPV: What would students be surprised to find in your refrigerator right now?\r\n\r\nAP: That\u2019s actually a really good question. I would say a homemade chicken broth, how\u2019s that sound? I\u2019m quite a cook and a chef, and I like to make stocks and broths, so that might be something that isn\u2019t a normal, everyday item.\r\n\r\nPV: What is something that has surprised you about Paly so far?\r\n\r\nAP: I think one thing that has surprised me a lot is the history actually that a lot of people have. A lot of teachers I\u2019ve talked to and parents during Back to School Night talk about when they went to Paly, especially the teachers, you know,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been here for 20 years!\u201d or \u201c30 years\u201d and \u201cI was a student here at Paly, too!\u201d Usually you might have a couple teachers, but it seems like a lot of the teachers I\u2019ve talked to have a past, which matters on how the school culture is built here.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with new Dean of Students Adam Paulson to learn how his time at Palo Alto High School is going so far.
