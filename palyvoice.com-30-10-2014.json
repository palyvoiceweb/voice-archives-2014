The lunch rally will include two new games this year: \"Mannequin Painting\" and \"Rapid Fire,\" according to the Associated Student Body's Spirit Week <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/a\/palyvoice.com\/document\/d\/1bPEzIA7J8f9gzzhj8F6MBPIL22QhTcWecieUYFyMTGM\/edit?pli=1\" target=\"_blank\">master doc<\/a>.\r\n\r\nFor \"Mannequin Painting,\" four students from each grade must completely paint a white mannequin in their respective class color within three minutes with paintbrushes only. The\u00a0scores for \"Mannequin Painting\" will be announced after the rally to give judges time to inspect the mannequins, and first place will receive 300 points.\r\n\r\n\"Rapid Fire\" involves two students from each grade knocking over 10 cans from a distance using rubber bands. The winners of this activity will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with recent\u00a0years, there will be a multi-round 3-point contest in the gym during Advisory, with one girl and one boy from each class competing. The shooter has to make as many 3-pointers as possible within a minute, and the winners from both genders will each earn 100 points for their grade.\r\n\r\nFreshman Adee Newman believes that the 3-point contest will fare better than rally activities so far for her class.\r\n\r\n\"In the\u00a03-point contest, we're going to do pretty well because we have some really good basketball players, but tomorrow at the rally at lunch, I don't think we're going to do as well,\" Newman said. \"We haven't had that much success [so far], which isn't that good, but at least we tried \u2013 that's the thing that matters.\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Newman is excited for the baby-themed apparel.\r\n\r\n\"I'm looking forward for tomorrow for dressing up as a baby and being really comfortable,\" Newman said.\r\n\r\nJunior Bryn Sullivan said she has her sophisticates outfit planned out for Generations Day.\r\n\r\n\"We're sophisticates, so [I'm wearing a] black skirt, a blazer, a blue shirt, a leather handbag and a coffee mug,\" Sullivan said.\r\n\r\nWith the juniors maintaining the lead,\u00a0the seniors hope to improve throughout the rest of the week.\r\n\r\n\"I think [because of] the Spirit Dance, float building and our improvement in cheers, the seniors will take the lead,\" senior Cary Faulkner said.\r\n\r\nMake sure to keep up with all things Spirit Week, including slideshows and point break-downs, by checking back with <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/spiritweek-2014\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Paly Voice<\/a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"More than halfway through Spirit Week, Palo Alto High School students are preparing for \"Generations Day\" with new rally activities in store.","date":"2014-10-29 20:59:57","author":"Lizzie Chun","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_6331.jpg","categories":["Spirit Week 2014"],"tags":{"31302":"3 point","10098":"basketball","8729":"Generations day","31301":"mannequin painting","8944":"palo alto high school","9852":"rally","9119":"Spirit Week","27181":"spirit week 2014","9162":"Thursday"}},{"id":77566,"title":"Slideshow: Spirit Week Day Three","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/29\/slideshow-spirit-week-day-three\/","content":"Day Three of Spirit Week kicked off with the \"Hula Hoop\" brunch rally, resulting in a senior victory.

The Wildcats outscored the Vikings 42-0 in the final three quarters, as the Vikings defense surrendered 256 rushing yards and five touchdowns on the ground. This week, head coach Jake Halas emphasized moving on from last week's disaster and focusing on the pass-heavy offense of Santa Clara.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_77412\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/10722247_771709889553738_1626690407_o1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-77412\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/10722247_771709889553738_1626690407_o1.jpg\" alt=\"Junior receiver Oliver Svirsky cradles in a pass during the Vikings 20-19 loss against Wilcox.

The Vikings return home this Friday to take on the Santa Clara Bruins. Photo by Josh Yuen.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\"To win a football game, you have to be able to stop the run and run the ball,\" Halas said. \"Obviously, we had a heck of a time shutting down Los Gatos' running game. Having said that, we're playing a team that throws the ball 75 percent of the time, so even though they do have a running game, they throw the ball a lot. That's what we're focusing on more. But if they want to run the ball, we have to stop it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bruins, still winless against league opponents, are coming off of a break-out 54-14 victory over the Lynbrook Vikings (0-7, 0-3) from the El Camino League. Despite a disappointing performance last week, junior wide receiver and captain Eli Givens said that the Vikings' mindset has not wavered from its winning attitude.\r\n\r\n\"We're just going to continue onto this week's game and forget about last week's,\" Givens said. \"Our mindset is to just win this week. Again, finish plays and make every play count and win.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked about potential rainy weather forecasted for Friday evening, Halas said that his team is eager to build off of previous success that they have had in bad weather.\r\n\r\n\"We've had great success in bad weather games since I've been here,\" Halas said. \"I like it. The kids like it. We're looking forward to it.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the contest will have a more ceremonial vibe to it due to homecoming activities, Givens accentuated that the team is treating it just like any other game.\r\n\r\n\"It's just another game to play,\" Givens said. \"It's another chance to get the W [win].\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings and Bruins kick off at 7 p.m. this Friday, Oct. 31 at Hod Ray Field. All fans are encouraged to wear as much black as they can to display their Paly spirit, according to senior Livi Clarissa Musil.

The\u00a0T4 brand started in Taiwan in 2004\u00a0and is working its way around the globe, according to its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.t4.com.tw\/en\/about.php#a1\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a>.\r\n\r\nT4 replaced the Loving Hut, which went out of business at the beginning of the school year. Loving Hut served PMT while it was in business, but it was vegan and had very few flavor options.\r\n\r\nMany Palo Alto High School students have been impatiently waiting for a PMT place in Palo Alto.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's hard to be environmentally friendly when you have to drive all the way to Mountain View to get a quality PMT drink,\" sophomore Nathaniel Hancock said. \"It also would take up a large amount of a day that could be spent doing homework or socializing.\"\r\n\r\n<em>What I ordered:<\/em>\u00a0<del><\/del>Large Jasmine Pearl milk tea with extra pearls ($4.89)\r\n\r\n<em>Overall Rating:<\/em> 7.5\/10\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_77486\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_0811.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-77486\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_0811.jpg\" alt=\"T4 has a lot of customer options for sweetness and ice amounts.

The menu provides the customer with a variety of options. For example, both the ice and sweetness levels can be adjusted from the standard to be at 30 percent or 80 percent.\r\n\r\nI personally got the standard amounts and found it a little sweet. The pearls are fairly large and very soft. The drink itself is not very thick and creamy, but the tea flavor is not overpowering.\r\n\r\nThe current Palo Alto location is very clean and has a blue color theme around the entire restaurant. There is room for seating, and it is easy to see into the back work area where the drinks are made.\r\n\r\nThe staff is very friendly and can answer any questions. Manager Miki Murphy was excited to mention that all tea is brewed on site and changed out every hour, even if it not used up completely.\r\n\r\nT4 is currently scheduled to be open from 11 a.m. to 11\u00a0p.m.\u00a0and currently does not have a significant line.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s delicious.

We gave it 100 percent, and it paid off,\" d'Arezzo said. \"Tug-of-war was great.\"\n\nSenior participant of the tug-of-war, Michael Pappas, is looking at the positives and trying to help the senior class as much as he can.\n\n\"I'm not exactly proud, but it's better than last place,\" Pappas said. \"I'm looking at the glass half full. I'm just trying to go out there and do a good job for my team.\"\n\nToday\u2019s scores will be posted by ASB after float building tonight.
