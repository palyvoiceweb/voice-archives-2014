Photo by Lizzie Chun.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAfter over six years of planning, the Media Arts Center and the combined Social Science and Math buildings are officially in use for Palo Alto High School\u2019s 2014-15 school year.\r\n\r\nBoth buildings are accessible to students regularly, providing them with a contrasting setting and environment to other buildings on campus. The buildings are two-storied, and each offer new hang-out spots and furniture to Paly students.\r\n\r\nHistory teacher and Paly alumnus Steve Foug admires the new buildings and looks forward to teaching his students in the updated classrooms.\r\n\r\n\u201cI really like the newness of everything,\u201d Foug said. \u201cI was telling the kids in my class, \u2018You know that moment when you get an iPhone and you peel that plastic off of it when its brand new? There\u2019s that nice feeling to it.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nEach building has been designed to showcase modern features, such as new computers, elevators and glassy windows. According to Foug, the history building lets in more natural light and is much more central to campus than the previous building he was acquainted with.\r\n\r\nThe area outside of the new social science building has become a frequent hang-out spot for many students, according to Foug.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve already noticed a congregation area in front of the math and history building,\u201d Foug said.\r\n\r\nHowever, some students find the math and history building difficult to get to from their other classes, and thus do not want to spend their free time there.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like how they\u2019re open, but I don't like how they are so far away from everything,\u201d senior Kabria Dame said.\r\n\r\nAccording to senior Charlene Zhu, the new buildings also have another drawback; the stairs can be an obstacle because of the heavy crowds and limited space, causing some students to worry about being late to class.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey [the stairs] do slow me down because so many people are trying to go up and down them at once, especially the ones in the front, but it\u2019s just a small annoyance,\u201d Zhu said.\r\n\r\nHowever, some students are still very optimistic about the new building, regardless of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s not too big of an issue,\u201d sophomore Nathaniel Hancock said. \u201cThe people with complaints probably try to walk up the stairs at the time of a huge crowd, but the stairs are normally pretty empty for me.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite the extra distance and occasionally inconvenient stairs, the open space of each building adds new opportunities for teachers and students, according to English teacher Craig Bark who uses the MAC as a second classroom.\r\n\r\nIn the first week of school, Bark had his students conduct interviews for a personality profile class assignment in the MAC, which provided a cozy environment for his students.\r\n\r\n\u201cI let them use the MAC for interviews so that they are in a comfortable setting where they can spread out,\u201d Bark said. \u201cThey can find a nice place to work with their friend, where it\u2019s very relaxing.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Aiva Petriceks enjoys spending her prep in the MAC because of the quiet work environment and spacious attributes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a good amount of people in there [the MAC],\u201d Petriceks said. \u201cI can see it becoming one of the new places where everyone will go on rainy days.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe proposition for the new buildings <a title=\"Paly to apply for $3 million media arts grant\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2009\/09\/03\/node-21594\/\" target=\"_blank\">arose<\/a> in 2008 and construction began in 2011. The buildings officially opened last week.\r\n\r\nAfter coming to the MAC every day for classes and conferences during the first week of school, Bark says he already feels at home in the new building.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a row of seats in a classroom with somebody sitting behind you breathing down your neck,\u201d Bark said. \u201cIt\u2019s bean bags, it\u2019s upstairs, it\u2019s space.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough other teachers have been able to make fairly quick transitions, Foug saysthat he needs more time to adjust to the new building since he had strong ties to his old classroom in the 300 building.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was there [my old classroom] for 15 years,\u201d Foug said. \u201cAll my old desks are gone. Those are some of the classrooms where I had history when I was a student. Everything doesn\u2019t feel like home yet.\u201d","excerpt":"&nbsp; After over six years of planning, the Media Arts Center and the combined Social Science and Math buildings are officially in use for Palo <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/08\/25\/new-buildings-officially-in-use-for-2014-15-school-year\/#more-'\" class=\"more-link\">more &raquo;<\/a>","date":"2014-08-25 20:21:46","author":"Adele Bloch","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/MG_3295.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"23599":"charlene zhu","18366":"mac","11127":"media arts center","23598":"steve foug"}},{"id":72649,"title":"Slideshow: Media Arts ribbon-cutting highlights annual school picnic","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/08\/23\/slideshow-media-arts-ribbon-cutting-highlights-annual-school-picnic\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School Parent Teacher Student Association hosted the annual Welcome-Back-to-School dinner on Thursday evening, featuring the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new Media Arts Center, student performances and food trucks.\r\n\r\nPrincipal Kim Diorio, Paly journalism advisers Paul Kandell and Esther Wojcicki, former California State Senator Joe Simitian and Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education President Barb Mitchell spoke during the ceremony.\r\n\r\nEach thanked the numerous people involved in the MAC project, including past Principal Jacqueline McEvoy, the boosters, previous advisers Ellen Austin and Mike McNulty, the Facilities Steering Committee, the school Board, Paly administration, the architects and various donors.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wojcicki, there will also be a three day-long grand opening of the MAC starting Oct 16.\r\n\r\nArianna Huffington, founder of The Huffington Post, will attend the event on Oct. 16, and Paly alumnus James Franco will be there on Oct. 18, according to Wojcicki.\r\n\r\nGlobal Voices, which \"curate[s], verif[ies] and translate[s] trending news and stories you might be missing on the Internet, from blogs, independent press and social media in 167 countries,\" <a title=\"Global Voices\" href=\"http:\/\/globalvoicesonline.org\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\">according to its website<\/a>, will be there for a week and will be featured on Oct. 17.\r\n\r\n[slideshow post_id=72649]","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Parent Teacher Student Association hosted the annual Welcome-Back-to-School dinner on Thursday evening, featuring the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new Media Arts Center, student performances and food trucks.","date":"2014-08-23 10:16:26","author":"Lizzie Chun","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/DSC_0091.jpg","categories":["Slideshow","Spotlight"],"tags":{"22661":"back to school dinner","18366":"mac","11127":"media arts center","22663":"ribbon cutting","9107":"slideshow","22662":"welcome back to school"}},{"id":72651,"title":"Admin: Adam Paulson selected as new Dean of Students","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/08\/21\/admin-adam-paulson-selected-as-new-dean-of-students\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2014-08-21 23:34:08","author":"Lizzie Chun","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":{"22665":"adam paulson","22666":"admin","22664":"dean of students","11237":"tosa"}},{"id":72640,"title":"Media Arts Center to receive grand opening","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/08\/21\/media-arts-center-to-receive-grand-opening\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_72645\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/welcome-back-dinner-sign.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-72645\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/welcome-back-dinner-sign.png\" alt=\"A sign announcing the Welcome-Back-To-School Dinner hangs on a portable in the Quad.

Photo by Emma Chiu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAfter about three years of construction, the grand opening of Palo Alto High School\u2019s new Media Arts Center will be held late Thursday afternoon, before the annual Welcome-Back-to-School dinner.\r\n\r\nThe approximately 15-minute ceremony will begin at 5 p.m. at the MAC with an opening from Paly Principal Kim Diorio, followed by some words by Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education President Barb Mitchell, according to head of Media Arts Boosters Debbie Crouch.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Welcome-Back picnic is kind of what drove us to have the ribbon cutting at that time because we\u2019d have a group of people on campus,\u201d Crouch said.\r\n\r\nDiorio and Mitchell will thank members of the district office who were involved, the people who ran the construction project and the Brin-Wojcicki Foundation, which has <a title=\"Brin-Wojcicki Donation\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/03\/25\/foundation-donates-funds-for-media-arts-equipment\/\" target=\"_blank\">donated<\/a> around $80,000 for extra equipment in the building\u2019s classrooms, computer lab, kitchen, atrium and more. The foundation\u2019s donation was an icing on the cake to the $50,000 already raised by boosters, $10 million paid for by Measure A and a $2.7 million state Career-Technical Education grant the project won.\r\n\r\nAccording to Crouch, the ceremony will end with an official ribbon-cutting by Diorio, Crouch and others to officially complete the project that was kicked off by the passage of Measure A in June 2008. These representatives of the long-term project will even use official scissors for the occasion.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boosters bought the big ceremonial scissors that are 38 inches tall so a lot of people can hold on to them,\u201d Crouch said.\r\n\r\nAs an administrator who has been involved with the MAC project for quite some time, Diorio is enthusiastic about the opening of the building.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited about this building and this space because I think it\u2019s really innovative and creative in nature and in design,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cI think obviously it was built to showcase our media arts programs ... but I think it will be more than that. Not just a classroom space, but a space the whole school will benefit from because there\u2019s a lot of smaller spaces within the building that people can go to [and] collaborate.\u201d\r\n\r\nDiorio also anticipates the building to be used not just for classroom purposes, but for meetings and event hostings as well.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna use it [the MAC] for staff meetings, [and] we\u2019ll use that atrium area for a lot of events,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cI think the Media Arts boosters are working on lining up some different speakers. Because it can hold about 150-200 people, we can easily seat that, and that\u2019s just on the ground floor.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo continue the celebration of the MAC\u2019s grand opening, the PTSA will be hosting the annual Welcome Back Dinner at the Quad. As a new experiment this year, the food will be provided entirely by food trucks.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll cut the ribbon and then folks can do a couple of things,\u201d said head of district public relations Tabitha Hurley Kappeler. \u201cThey can either go back over to the Quad where there will be the food trucks, or they can do tours [of the MAC].\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Diorio, the event has used the same caterer for many years and the PTSA just wanted to do something a little different and a little more exciting.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe [ PTSA President Barb Schroeder] approached me back in the spring and said, \u2018What if we did food trucks\u2019 and I said \u2018sure, let\u2019s try it,\u2019\u201d Diorio said.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Paly Link bulletin email, the dinner will include Takoz Mod Mex-Mexican, Rice Rockit (Filipino\/Hawaiian Fusion) and Paddy Wagon Sliders. Lastly, Kona Ice-Shaved Ice will have a parking spot on the Quad to serve dessert.\r\n\r\nThe Welcome Back Dinner will also include a number of performances from student groups, including the dance and cheer teams, as well as Paly\u2019s own band and choir.\r\n\r\n\u201cGiven the two new buildings being open and the food trucks and the student performances, it should be a fun night,\u201d Dioro said.","excerpt":"After about three years of construction, the grand opening of Palo Alto High School\u2019s new Media Arts Center will be held late Thursday afternoon, before <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/08\/21\/media-arts-center-to-receive-grand-opening\/#more-'\" class=\"more-link\">more &raquo;<\/a>","date":"2014-08-21 00:12:15","author":"Emma Chiu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/welcome-back-dinner-sign.png","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":[]},{"id":72581,"title":"Construction limits space in Embarcadero lot","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/08\/20\/construction-limits-space-in-embarcadero-lot\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_72587\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"357\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-7.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-72587\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-7.jpg\" alt=\"Construction of the new building has taken over part of the previous Embarcadero lot.

Photo by Maddy Jones.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPalo Alto High School students and faculty alike are learning to cope with the loss of parking space after construction on the new Performing Arts Center began over the summer, blocking off a portion of the Embarcadero Road parking lot.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the Performing Arts Center has taken up 107\u00a0parking spots from the Embarcadero lot, most of which were staff parking, and has caused the administration to paint 65 new staff parking spaces in the lot. Students have also gained 27 parking spaces to compensate for the loss of space in the Embarcadero Road lot; however, these spaces are on the other side of campus in the Churchill Avenue lot, where maintenance workers used to park. Once new construction for the Big Gym begins, 32 more spots will be lost from the Churchill parking lot. According to Assistant Principal Jerry Berskon, the combined construction\u00a0of both the Big Gym and the Performing Arts Center\u00a0will cause\u00a0a net loss of 112 parking spaces.\r\n\r\nDue to the reduced number of spaces this year, parking permits will first\u00a0be issued to seniors only. Seniors can pick up parking permit applications starting August 21 in the Auditor's Office, but it will be three weeks until enforcement of parking permits begins for the Paly lots, according to Berkson. The Associated Student Body, which decides the cost of a parking permit, has set the price for a parking permit at 120, as opposed to last year's price of 80 dollars.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_72583\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"229\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-72583\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-3.jpg\" alt=\"The gate to the bike path can be found behind the history 300 building.

This can be used by students to access Town and Country Village across the street. Photo by Maddy Jones.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will be seniors only to start,\" Berkson said. \"If we figure out that there\u2019s X amount left over, then we\u2019ll probably have a lottery for juniors.\u00a0Either that or other creative ideas: maybe there\u2019s Monday-Wednesday-Friday and Tuesday-Thursday parking permits. We\u2019re trying to be as fair as possible without it being crazy.\u201d\r\n\r\nBerkson added that there will probably be 32 temporary parking permits handed out as well for spots that will be taken away once the Big Gym project begins during winter break.\r\n\r\nWithin the first week of school the limited number of spots has inconvenienced many driving-aged Paly students, like senior Megan Valencia. Since enforcement of parking permits has not begun, the imbalance between the greater number of students who wish to park and parking spaces has created competition for spaces.\r\n\r\n\"I've had to change my route and go to the Churchill parking lot instead of the Embarcadero parking lot,\" Valencia said. \"Since they aren't enforcing parking permits yet, anyone can park there [in the Embarcadero parking lot] and there aren't any spots.\"\r\n\r\nConstruction for the Performing Arts Center is expected to last 18 months, which would make it end in the middle of the 2015-16 school year. Until construction is over, it is expected that parking permits will continue to be issued with senior priority, according to Berkson.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_72595\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"234\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-8.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-72595\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-8.jpg\" alt=\"New walkways have been set up to accommodate expected pedestrians and bikes coming through the parking lot.

Photo by Maddy Jones.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOnce construction for the Performing Arts Center is complete, it is expected that 47 new student\u00a0spots in the main Embarcadero lot will open up and that 25 spots will open up in the parking lot behind the Media Arts Center. Additionally, Berkson said that the senior-priority for parking will be dropped.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a lack of parking, the construction is also blocking off the path to the crosswalk leading to Town and Country Village. There are now two ways for students to get to the popular lunchtime destination. One alternative \u00a0is located behind the 300 building where there is a gate that leads to the bike path that connects over to Town and Country, and the other option is to go up to the main crosswalk at the Embarcadero-El Camino intersection.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_72585\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"322\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-5.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-72585\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-5.jpg\" alt=\"A new bike rack has been set up between the administration building and the Embarcadero parking lot.

At the end of these walkways and bikeways, two new bike racks have been added near the Tower\u00a0Building.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis has become more of a bike commute area than before, so they put the bike racks in there [by the Tower Building],\u201d Berkson said.\r\n\r\nWith all the new additions, Berkson stresses the importance of being alert and staying safe.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you are going to drive, be careful because it is a whole different configuration now,\" Berkson said. \"Even if you\u2019re paying attention, that doesn\u2019t mean the other people driving around are paying attention, so pay attention.\"","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School students and faculty alike are learning to cope with the loss of parking space after construction on the new Performing Arts Center began over the summer, blocking off a portion of the Embarcadero Road parking lot.","date":"2014-08-20 17:49:21","author":"Maddy Jones","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-7.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8616":"construction","8690":"facilities","20206":"new theater","20205":"parking lot","20204":"parking spaces"}},{"id":72561,"title":"Freshman orientation to start at 4 p.m. on Aug. 14 in the small gym","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/07\/07\/freshman-orientation-to-start-at-4-p-m-on-aug-14-in-the-small-gym\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2014-07-07 21:24:30","author":"Lizzie Chun","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":{"20198":"freshman orientation"}},{"id":72564,"title":"School photos for sophomores, juniors and seniors to be taken on Aug. 15","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/07\/07\/school-photos-for-sophomores-juniors-and-seniors-to-be-taken-on-aug-15\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2014-07-07 21:24:09","author":"Lizzie Chun","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":{"20200":"id","20199":"school photos"}},{"id":72510,"title":"Slideshow: Graduation 2014","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/06\/02\/slideshow-graduation-2014\/","content":"The Class of 2014 graduated from Palo Alto High School Wednesday from the Quad, girls donned in white and boys in green.

But to me, what the Quad really represents is learning; it is where we as students learn to be social.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve learned quite a bit about human interaction in high school classrooms. I\u2019ve learned about humans being social creatures, about how methods of communication have changed, about social tendencies. But let\u2019s be real here: in 10 years, we\u2019re only going to remember a fraction of what we\u2019ve learned in the classroom. Learning really happens outside the classroom, places like the Quad \u2014 at parties, at friends\u2019 houses, on meaningless car rides.\r\n\r\nJust as much as the Quad facilitates, it also depreciates. As hard as I try, I will rarely stand out from my peers on this patch of grass. There is little to differentiate one Viking from the other. So I began to wonder: Why is it so hard to stand out?\r\n\r\nConformity. In order to appease others\u2019 needs, we conform. The boys and girls we were on the first day of freshman year are long-lost from the young men and women we are today. For better or worse, we\u2019ve developed new habits, met new people and changed our lifestyles.\r\n\r\nOn the Quad, we conform. So today, I ask you this: On your last day at Paly, what have you done to be noticed?\r\n\r\nBoth inside and outside the classroom, it takes more effort to stand out than to go along with what everyone else is doing. And when we try to be different, we often fail. Thus, I have learned these four years that the answer to \u201cWhat can I do to stand out\u201d is just that: make mistakes.\r\n\r\nI hate mistakes. I hate them with all my power, and you probably do too, but we have to respect them.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you about a mistake I made:\r\n\r\nOn the very first day of senior year, on this very Quad, I made the mistake of taking off my clothes and running \u2014 ever so slowly \u2014 across the grass you sit on. Sure, it\u2019ll be a good story to tell my grandchildren one day, but it was in the heat of the moment, a moment of deindividuation.\r\n\r\nAs I dealt with a two-day suspension, I realized that I had a choice. I could choose how I wanted to be different. Two roads diverged in a wood, and I decided to take the one less traveled by. When I returned to school, I made sure that I did not let that incident define me. I made the conscious decision to stand out by building relationships with the administration, fostering conversation and \u2014 with the support of Ms. Diorio \u2014 helping usher in a new wave of senior legacy.\r\n\r\nTo me, standing out means accepting the learning potential that comes with the inevitable mistakes we have made and will make. It's not the mistake itself that makes us stand out, it's the process of making sense of the past in a way that provides true learning and growth that makes us stand out.\r\n\r\nAs we begin a new chapter in our lives, we must not be afraid to make mistakes, but more importantly, we must not be afraid to learn from them. Most will conform to the stigma that their mistake binds them to. Most will be afraid of standing out.\r\n\r\nClass of 2014: In order to differentiate ourselves, we must make mistakes. Be the one to fail. In fact, I challenge you to fail. Learn from such mistakes. Defy societal expectations and stand out for the right reasons: for being innovative, for being witty, for not conforming.\r\n\r\nConformity squanders potential. Embrace the accidental potential that lies within each of us.\r\n\r\nThank you, good night and good luck.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Click here to find:\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72343&amp;preview=true\">Part I<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72345&amp;preview=true\">Part II<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72348&amp;preview=true\">Part III<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72351&amp;preview=true\">Part IV<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72354&amp;preview=true\">Part V<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72367&amp;preview=true\">Part VI<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/28\/the-speeches-that-didnt-make-it-class-of-2014-part-vii\/\">Part VII<\/a>.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice acquired the following speeches from their authors, with their authors\u2019 consent to publish.
