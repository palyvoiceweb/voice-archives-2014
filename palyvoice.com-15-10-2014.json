And why does it matter?\r\n\r\nBack when we were juniors, we also had these questions. The PSAT\/NMSQT is a national test that students across the nation take, typically during their junior year. After you take the test, you receive your results, and if you score in or above the 96th percentile you could be recognized as a semifinalist at the beginning of your senior year, after which you have to submit your scores from the SAT and an essay in order to find out if you are a National Merit Scholar. This year, juniors at Palo Alto High School will be taking the PSAT on Wednesday as a part of College and Career Awareness Day.\r\n\r\nSo, what should you do about the PSAT?\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>The PSAT is linked to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationalmerit.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Merit Scholarships<\/a> (as the name implies), which means if you become a finalist, you could win scholarship money.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>National Merit looks good. It\u2019s an opportunity to pad your college app with a national award. Colleges love having National Merit Scholars. Becoming a finalist means getting scholarships from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationalmerit.org\/Merit_Sponsor_Leaflet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">schools like Washington University in St. Louis and Tufts University<\/a>, and even being a semi-finalist looks good.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>People who have already taken the SAT have a huge headstart. \u00a0If you are one of those people, don\u2019t sweat it. If you aren\u2019t, keep reading.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>You don\u2019t have to go overboard if you want to get a good score. In Advisory, you should have received a practice PSAT packet. Do that. To be honest, over-practicing can get you too hyped up, and stressing can cause a lot of people to under-perform. Three practice PSATs are plenty.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>If you\u2019re like the majority of Paly students who haven\u2019t gotten started with SAT prep, the PSAT is a perfect benchmark. If you don\u2019t care about National Merit, just go into it without studying. It can give you a good idea of the areas you\u2019re going to need to focus on when it comes to the actual SAT. Don\u2019t be the kid who starts studying for the SAT the week before and expects a 2400.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>If you don\u2019t like your score, don\u2019t worry! The PSAT is just a preliminary score. Plenty of people we know got scores they didn\u2019t like, and ended up scoring 200 points higher on the real thing. By using the right materials (e.g. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Official-Study-Guide-Second-Edition\/dp\/0874478529\" target=\"_blank\">THE OFFICIAL BIG BLUE BOOK<\/a> and free prep questions on <a href=\"https:\/\/connection.naviance.com\/family-connection\/auth\/login\/?hsid=pahs\" target=\"_blank\">Naviance<\/a>) or by getting the right test prep (AJ tutoring anyone?), you can greatly improve your score. Remember, the SAT is not for everyone. Plenty of people don\u2019t do well on the SAT but get a great ACT score. When results come in, compare your PSAT score to your PLAN score from sophomore year and figure out which test you want to take.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>STUDY, BUT DON\u2019T STRESS. If you don\u2019t get National Merit, you don\u2019t get National Merit. Remember that only the top, top percentage of students in the nation will get it. Some top schools like Princeton and Stanford don't even care if you got National Merit or not, as long as you do well on the actual test<\/li>\r\n\t<li>If you do get National Merit, when you\u2019re a senior, you can feel special when you get a call slip that isn\u2019t for detention or being a hooligan.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nGood luck you crazy kids!","excerpt":"Confused and concerned about the relevance of the upcoming PSAT?

The two elected members will replace current board members Barb Mitchell and Dana Tom, and will serve on the School Board for the next four years.\r\n\r\nThe newly-elected members will join the board as it faces multiple issues concerning the community. One of these issues involves the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights cases regarding a mishandled bullying incident, where opinions differ among candidates on necessary actions. Another issue is the increasing number of students in the district, which faces the need for a 13th elementary school and even possibly a fourth middle school. However, candidates unanimously agree on the need.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the newly-elected members must focus on the emotional well-being of students in a competitive environment and the need to improve transparency to ensure that the community is well-informed and cooperative.\r\n\r\nScroll down below for a brief profile of each candidate.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Catherine Crystal Foster<\/strong> \u2014 Founder and Principal at Policy &amp; Advocacy Consulting, 48\r\n\r\nFoster believes in instituting good teachers, implementing world language as core subjects at a younger age, enhancing students' writing skills and opening new schools. She expresses the necessity to shrink the achievement gap through concrete goals and allowing for students to reach their highest potential without increasing pressure from the community. Contrary to other candidates, Foster believes citizens should not blame the current School Board for the controversy involving the Office of Civil Rights without knowing the complete details, but still agrees with other candidates that the School Board should not spend precious resources on the case.\r\n\r\n<b style=\"color: #111111;\">Boldest Idea:\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"color: #111111;\">Evaluating specific issues to ensure the best actions and goals the district can achieve\r\n<\/span><b>Endorsers you've heard of:\u00a0<\/b>U.S. Congresswoman\u00a0Anna Eshoo, State Senator Jerry Hill\r\n<b>Campaign Finance:\u00a0<\/b>$29,039\r\n<b>Education:\u00a0<\/b>B.A. in History, Yale University\r\nJ.D., Harvard Law School\r\n<b>Family:\u00a0<\/b>Husband Jon and two children attending Paly and Nueva Middle School\r\n<b>Community Involvement:\u00a0<\/b>Former Site Council member of Duveneck Elementary School\r\nFormer PTA Council Liaison\r\nFormer board member of Palo Alto Partners in Education (PiE)\r\nBoard member of Palo Alto Community Fund\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Gina Dalma\u00a0<\/strong>\u2014 Executive Director at Community LIFE Network, 34\r\n\r\nDalma is focused on creating a collaborative, connected and creative educational program in schools in order for students to not just adapt to the changing 21st century, but to thrive in it.
