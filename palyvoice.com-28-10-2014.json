In the first incident, a girl was walking home from school on Bryant Street when a man masturbating in his truck stopped stopped beside her, according to the City of Palo Alto's press release. In the second incident, a girl was walking her dog on Byron Street and Seale Avenue when a man in a vehicle pulled up beside her and asked if she wanted to\u00a0touch\u00a0his exposed penis, according\u00a0to the City of Palo Alto's press release. In the third incident, a woman was biking on Miller Avenue when a masturbating driver called out to her, according to\u00a0the\u00a0City of Palo Alto's press release.<\/p>\r\n<p>It is evident that a lewd conduct encounter can occur in the most unexpected of times and places to both pedestrians and bikers of all ages.\u00a0According to Elizabeth, the 14-year-old victim whose name has been changed to protect her identity, the perpetrator looked like an ordinary man that she would find on the street.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"There was nothing really suspicious [about him],\" Elizabeth\u00a0told the Paly Voice.<\/p>\r\n<p>Although the\u00a0PAPD has begun to increase marked and unmarked patrol in student commute areas after the incidents, the public should\u00a0increase\u00a0its precautionary steps to avoid such circumstances, as it is impossible to tell when an incident could strike, according to the PAPD.<\/p>\r\n<p>While on the\u00a0next walk or bike ride, police suggest students to follow the steps below to ensure a safe trip:<\/p>\r\n<p><strong> 1. Be aware of your surroundings.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\"The most important one is being aware of your surroundings at all times, and simply paying attention to what's going on around you,\"\u00a0\u00a0PAPD officer Lt. Zachary Perron said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>The City\u00a0of Palo Alto has many positive connotations attached to its name, due to its continuous growth in the technology and business worlds. However, the public may often forget that crime can still be found within our beloved city. Individuals\u00a0must always be on the lookout for said crimes by constantly scanning\u00a0their\u00a0environment and looking for anything out of the ordinary. Although biking may feel safer than walking as\u00a0it is quicker to remove oneself from a situation, one of the recent incidents involved a biker. Therefore bikers are not exempt\u00a0from those that must constantly be aware of their surroundings.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"We're all busy people and have a lot of things on our minds, but it's important not to get lost in all of those things, and to always be cognizant of what's going on around you,\" Perron said.<\/p>\r\n<p>One way students can\u00a0increase their awareness\u00a0is by removing headphones from their ears while walking or biking home from a long day of school.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/teens.webmd.com\/news\/20120116\/headphones-while-walking-a-dangerous-move\">Webmd<\/a>\u00a0writes\u00a0that pedestrians with headphones often pay\u00a0little\u00a0attention to their surroundings, an effect called\u00a0environmental isolation,\u00a0which\u00a0has leads to large pedestrian risk.\u00a0In the most recent local cases, there has been a\u00a0repeated pattern of cars trailing behind the victim before exposure.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\"Too often, for example, students (and adults alike) will walk with headphones in both ears,\" Perron said. \"We recommend just one earbud so that you can hear if anything is happening around you.\"<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>After the incident, Elizabeth has implemented these tactics in her daily routine.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Just being extremely aware of your surroundings,\" Elizabeth\u00a0said. \"I don\u2019t listen to music when I walk home because you never know who's creeping up to you.\"<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Keep updated on the recent crimes.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Being knowledgable about where\u00a0and when\u00a0the most recent crimes have taken place in Palo Alto is essential to being\u00a0vigilant\u00a0and aware of current events that directly apply to our society. Reading\u00a0the news will allow you to know who to look out for, too. For example, the PAPD recently released sketches of the perpetrator in the hopes that individuals will recognize the person and call the police.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Connect with PAPD on social media, that's a great way to stay informed,\" Perron said.<\/p>\r\n<p>The public can receive criminal updates from the PAPD from its\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PaloAltoPolice\">Twitter<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PaloAltoPolice\">Facebook<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nextdoor.com\/%20\">Nextdoor<\/a>\u00a0or <a href=\"http:\/\/local.nixle.com\/palo-alto-police-department%20\">Nixle<\/a>\u00a0or the public can continually\u00a0check\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/\">Palo Alto Online<\/a>.

Zach Perron of the PAPD said. Screenshots of PAPD sketches by Amy Leung.[\/caption]<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Walk down the left side of the street. <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cThe cops recommend that when you\u2019re walking down, walk down the left side so at least you can see the cars coming up to you,\" Elizabeth\u00a0said.<\/p>\r\n<p>When possible, walking down the left side of the street is much safer than the right\u00a0as\u00a0there is a full lane between the pedestrian and the cars on the right. This makes it much harder for the cars\u00a0to sneak up on the pedestrian, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.saferoutesinfo.org\/\">National Center for Safe Routes to School<\/a>. \u00a0The cars coming towards the pedestrian on the left side are visible by the pedestrian, giving them more reaction time in case of an emergency. Although bikers must follow the same rules of the road as the cars\u00a0to\u00a0stay on the right side of the street,\u00a0it is vital that bikers stay aware of their surroundings.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Stay calm and get out of the situation quickly.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>In a lewd conduct\u00a0scenario, it is very easy for individuals to freeze up in shock. However, it is imperative to stay calm and logical. The faster one can get out of the situation and call the cops, the safer they will be and the more likely the culprit will get caught, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.justyellfire.com\/news.php?article=How_to_React_to_Exhibitionists_and_Indecent_Exposure_407\">Just Yell Fire<\/a>, a program dedicated to combating violence against young women.\u00a0If possible and safe, the public should do their best to remember the culprit's facial features, car or license plate number to report to the police\u00a0quickly afterwards.<\/p>\r\n<p>According to Just Yell Fire, body language expert Patti Woods recommends, \"They are seeking attention and want a strong reaction. Keep your full body, feet, torso and head turned away and try not to give any strong emotional response to his behavior. Then move away and call the authorities with a description so the flasher is caught.\"<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Run in the opposite direction of the perpetrator's car.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>\"People\u00a0see action movies where people are chasing you or attempting to kidnap you and you start running forward,\" Elizabeth\u00a0said. \"That\u2019s pretty idiotic. ... If you are running backwards [in the opposite direction], it's way harder [for a car] to back up. I think one method [of safety] is to go the other direction versus still going forward.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the best ways to get out of a scary situation that involves a car is to run in the direction that they are not going in. It is much harder for a car to turn around and catch someone if they are running in the opposite direction that the\u00a0car itself is going.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Report an indecent exposure immediately.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>\"This is important stuff that the police should know, because they\u2019re trying to keep the community safe,\" Elizabeth said. \"The more people aware of that [the exposures], the better.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>It is easy to feel embarrassed about the situation at hand, and therefore stay quiet about it. For example, a similar scenario occurred with a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PaloAltoPolice\/photos\/pb.288613124507825.-2207520000.1414368283.\/751096094926190\/?type=3&amp;theater\">13-year-old<\/a>\u00a0who recently came out about a lewd conduct encounter\u00a0that happened over the summer, according to the PAPD. It\u00a0is essential to report the case immediately. The PAPD is already on heightened patrol, and it is\u00a0waiting to respond to any new reports that come in.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\"While some people may think it's a relatively 'minor' crime, it certainly is not, and the crime can actually be a precursor to substantially more serious crimes,\" Perron said. \"It's not uncommon for indecent exposure suspects to escalate their behavior over time, so if we can catch them early, that may prevent a more serious crime down the road.\"<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>If you are the victim or witness of an incident, the PAPD asks you to report it to them immediately.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cWe ask that if people see anything that seems out of the ordinary, that they give us a call right away on 9-1-1,\" Perron said.\u00a0\"It\u2019s better to call right away and let us determine if the suspicious behavior is innocent or criminal, than to justify suspicious activity and not call.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyone with information regarding suspicious behavior\u00a0is asked to\u00a0call the PAPD\u00a024-hour dispatch center at (650) 329-2413. Anonymous tips can be e-mailed\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:paloalto@tipnow.org\">here<\/a>\u00a0or sent via text message or voice mail to (650) 383-8984. Tips can also be submitted anonymously through the PAPD\u00a0free mobile app, downloadable at the\u00a0<a href=\"bit.ly\/PAPD-AppStore\">AppStore<\/a>\u00a0or <a href=\"bit.ly\/PAPD-GooglePlay\">GooglePlay<\/a>. The PAPD\u00a0asks that if people see anything that seems out of the ordinary, they should give the PAPD\u00a0or\u00a09-1-1 a call immediately.<\/p>\r\n","excerpt":"In light of the indecent exposures in Palo Alto within the last month, here are various safety tips the public should take to avoid lewd conduct encounters and help police in their search.","date":"2014-10-27 20:47:11","author":"Adele Bloch","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/flashersketches1.jpg","categories":["Features","Spotlight"],"tags":{"30922":"flashing","30919":"indecent exposure","30921":"lewd conduct","8939":"palo alto","30920":"palo alto online","13030":"PAPD","9000":"police","14866":"tips","30923":"victim"}},{"id":77254,"title":"Spirit Week to continue with \u201cSalad Dressing\u201d Day","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/27\/spirit-week-to-continue-with-salad-dressing-day\/","content":"Palo Alto High School students will dress up according to their\u00a0class's respective\u00a0salad-dressing theme for Day Two of Spirit Week.\r\n\r\nThe themes for tomorrow are as follows in\u00a0ascending\u00a0grade order: \u201cHealthy Choice,\u201d \u201cRanch,\u201d \u201cThousand Islands\u201d and \u201cCaesar.\u201d For dress-up ideas, click <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/23\/must-have-spirit-week-outfits\/\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThe event for the rally at the football field tomorrow is Tug\u00a0of\u00a0War.

The PAPD is uncertain whether there is only one suspect or multiple suspects involved.\r\n\r\nThe first indecent exposure disturbance, which occurred at 4:47 p.m. on Oct. 6 at the 1600 block of Bryant Street, was reported by 14 year-old-girl. Back in early August between 1 and 2 p.m., a 13-year-old girl had been flashed with a similar description of the suspect on the 1600 block of Bryant Street, and saw the flasher again later on the 1500 block of Emerson Street.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_77223\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"450\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Screen-Shot-2014-10-26-at-4.12.20-PM2.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-77223\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Screen-Shot-2014-10-26-at-4.12.20-PM2.png\" alt=\"A PAPD sketch of the flasher, as described by the 14-year-old female victim.

To hear [that] people are being flashed, that definitely makes me a little scared to just walk around by myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nPetriceks also said that people should be cautious.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor girls, definitely walk in groups of people,\u201d Petriceks said. \u201cBeing a teenage girl, walking around by yourself and getting flashed, that\u2019s really scary and... not safe.\u201d\r\n\r\nSophomore Carter Faust agrees with Petriceks, giving more advice.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s kind of creepy, especially since everyone bikes to school,\u201d Faust said. \u201cThey [the PAPD] should patrol more, and people should bike together.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Perron, the PAPD\u00a0 is doing just that.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe increased staffing levels, redistributed personnel to field assignments and have a number of plainclothes officers in the neighborhoods trying to find the suspect,\u201d Perron said.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the PAPD has been releasing sketches and will continue to do so in order to bring awareness and help recognize suspects.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy releasing sketches of the suspect, we hope that someone will recognize the person and give us a call with a tip,\u201d Perron said.\r\n\r\n\"We need people to keep their eyes out for any suspicious behavior,\" Perron said. \"We ask that if people see anything that seems out of the ordinary, that they give us a call right away on 9-1-1. \u00a0It's always better to call right away and let us determine if the suspicious behavior is innocent or criminal, than to justify suspicious activity and not call.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"After recent incidences of indecent exposure, the Palo Alto Police Department has increased patrols and Paly students have expressed their feelings of discomfort.

If you need some inspiration for outfits, check out these suggestions\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/23\/must-have-spirit-week-outfits\/\">here<\/a>. The senior theme is \"Great Gatsby,\" but seniors\u00a0will be donning their customary '90s attire. Juniors will be dressing as \"Pirates\" based off of their class color yellow. The sophomores will sport athletic attire based off their theme \"Red Card.\" The freshman theme is \"The Lion King,\" but their outfits may also include any other Disney character.\r\n\r\nMonday's rally will be held on the football field at lunch. According to Student Activities Director Matt Hall, there will be three Minute to Win It games, where contestants have one minute to complete the given task. The two new games are \"Shake it\" and \"Nose Dive,\" and the one returning game from last year's Spirit Week is \"Banana Bump.\"\r\n\r\n\"After a wild and crazy introduction last year, we decided to keep it ['Banana Bump'],\" Hall said. \"It got approved, so we're going to do it, and that will be fun.\"\r\n\r\nTo play \"Shake it,\" one representative from each class will have one pedometer strapped to a leg and arm each. Participants then will move around for one minute, and those with the highest number of \"steps\" at the end wins. \"Nose Dive\" also requires one participant from each grade.\u00a0The task for \"Nose Dive\" is to transfer the greatest number of cotton balls from one bowl to another using just petroleum jelly on the contestant's noses. The returning game from last year, \"Banana Bump,\" requires one participant from each class to attach a banana to their waist by string and push an orange on the ground to the finish line.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_77053\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"275\"]<img class=\"wp-image-77053\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_6292.jpg\" alt=\"Freshmen dress according to their theme &quot;Warning\/Under Construction&quot; during Spirit Week 2013.
