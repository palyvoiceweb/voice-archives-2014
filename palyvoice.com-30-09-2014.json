But when the job was put off for the next two to three years, I asked Principal Kim Diorio if we could find a donor, and she did.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly\u00a0administration members, including Diorio, became aware of issues with the old furniture after using it themselves\u00a0last year.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were a number of teachers who became students for a day,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cDiorio said she sat for an hour in our comfortable chairs pretending to be a student and she realized it was just a really tough place to be. The furniture didn\u2019t work, so she understood the need before any other administrator.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents have mostly enjoyed the new look and feel of the library.\r\n\r\n\u201cI really like some of the new seats,\u201d senior Ken Shin said. \u201cThey\u2019re very comfortable, and they\u2019re much nicer than what we had last year.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly\u00a0chose the furniture through a selection process in order to create an ideal library environment for students, according to Kellerman.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe talked to Shelly Young from Workplace Connections who [designed] the Media Arts Center furniture,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cI also talked to another company that specializes in library furniture called Demco. We got samples in from both vendors, and kids sat in the chairs and did polls. ...\u00a0We ended up going with Shelly Young\u2019s design because we were able to get [more of a]\u00a0variety of colors, and the tables were more flexible.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe library features some new types of furnitures, including caf\u00e9 high tables, designed to encourage collaboration, as well as single desks with dividers.\r\n\r\n\"I like the dividers,\" junior Ophir Sneh said. \"The library can be pretty distracting sometimes, so they help keep me focused.\"\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of the new furniture \u00a0is its\u00a0compatibility.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the furniture in the Media Arts Center is the same, so it\u2019s all interchangeable.\u201d Kellerman said.","excerpt":"After delaying the remodeling of the Palo Alto High School Library, Paly administration is encouraging students to use the new furniture put in place as compensation.","date":"2014-09-29 17:23:33","author":"Ido Gal","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/10410821_854293477923970_8433335301805375494_n.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"21437":"bond","8616":"construction","21438":"delay","11130":"furniture","21439":"Kellerman","8848":"Library","8912":"new"}},{"id":74066,"title":"Local nonprofit invites community to &#8220;step out of your world&#8221;","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/29\/local-nonprofit-invites-community-to-step-out-of-your-world\/","content":"The Global Lives Project, a San Francisco based nonprofit organization,\u00a0will exhibit an interactive video display focused on broadening cross-cultural understanding and empathy during the week-long\u00a0grand opening of the Palo Alto High School Media Arts Center starting Oct. 13.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_74683\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"400\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_7620.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-74683\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_7620.jpg\" alt=\"David Harris, Executive Director of Global Lives, explains the purpose of the Global Lives Project to Palo Alto High School staff at a faculty meeting.

The installation will be displayed in the MAC nonstop throughout the five days of the building's grand opening.\r\n\r\nAccording to the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/globallives.org\/about\/overview\/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Lives website<\/a>, the purpose of the project is to \"explore the diversity of human experience\u00a0...\u00a0and encourage discussion, reflection,and inquiry about the wide variety of cultures, ethnicities, languages, and religions on this planet.\"\r\n\r\nDavid Harris, the Executive Director of Global Lives and a Mountain View High School alumnus, said Global Lives focuses on\u00a0two main questions: What could global empathy look like,\u00a0and what are the boundaries of an individual's\u00a0moral universe?\r\n\r\nThe exhibit displays the days of the participants in real time to the audience as if they were on the PST time zone, according to teacher Eric Bloom.\r\n\r\n\"In the morning, it'll be their [the participants'] morning, wherever they are in the world, so there's an idea about kids just keep coming back,\" Bloom said. \"They'll see different parts of the day, and they can reflect on what they're doing in their day and what somebody else is doing in their day.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the Paly community is free to view the exhibit throughout the day, teachers may also schedule self-guided, \"Meet the Filmmaker\" and docent-led tours via Schoology. All tours are scheduled to\u00a0last about 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with curriculum design professor Denise Pope from the Stanford University School of Eduation, Global Lives\u00a0also developed a teaching curriculum called \"Unheard Stories\" for middle and high school students. It is aligned with the English and history Common Core standards and consists of three parts: Understanding Myself, Barriers to Understanding and Understanding Others.\r\n\r\nSome Paly teachers have integrated\u00a0the curriculum into their classes, including the Social Justice Pathway.\r\n\r\n\"Erin [Angell] and I used it [the curriculum] in our Social Justice Pathway to give kids an opportunity to think about who they are and what influences them and then give them the chance to look into the lives of others,\" Bloom said.\r\n\r\nHarris encourages the use of the Global Lives website, which includes some of the exhibit videos, biographies of participants and an interactive map that shows connections between participants, to supplement the curriculum.\r\n\r\nPart of the Global Lives Project exhibit is currently on display at the local think tank Institute for the Future in downtown Palo Alto.\r\n\r\nHarris is looking forward to the project\u00a0being displayed\u00a0in the MAC.\r\n\r\n\"I have to say, this [the MAC] is one of the most exciting spaces I've had to work with in a long time,\" Harris said. \"Between your [Paly's] 14 different screens built into the walls here and the eight screens Global Lives will be bringing in ... this will be the first place we've ever shown all 20 of the Global Lives videos ... so this is a really cool opportunity for me as a filmmaker and artist, as well.\"","excerpt":"The Global Lives Project, a San Francisco based nonprofit organization, will exhibit an interactive video display focused on broadening cross-cultural understanding and empathy during the week-long grand opening of the Palo Alto High School Media Arts Center starting Oct. 13.","date":"2014-09-29 17:20:55","author":"Lizzie Chun","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_7620.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"29316":"curriculum","29220":"david evan harris","29219":"david harris","29221":"denise pope","29026":"exhibit","29025":"global lives","29222":"global lives project","18366":"mac","11127":"media arts center","8944":"palo alto high school","29027":"project","9653":"stanford","29028":"unheard stories"}},{"id":75059,"title":"What&#8217;s in my bag: Dorothy Han","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/29\/whats-in-my-bag-dorothy-han\/","content":"<code><iframe src=\"\/\/www.thinglink.com\/card\/573253626114342914\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/code>\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice went around asking students what they have in their bag in order to find out more about who they are.

Hull, a team captain, braved through several rough hits and instigated a few solid drives for the Vikings. Head coach Jake Halas credits Hull's work ethic and attitude every game to the quarterback switch.\r\n\r\n\"<span style=\"color: #3e454c;\">He's a gamer,\" Halas said after the loss. \"That's why he's in there at quarterback.

Despite watching the Chieftains take full control of the game early in the fourth quarter, Puckett is proud of the way that the team stuck together and kept playing until the end.\r\n\r\n\"Our team kept fighting and pushing,\" Puckett said. \"We just kept fighting and tried to make something happen, something positive. I can say that we worked more as a team tonight, something that we've been struggling do.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chieftains offense, highlighted by sophomore phenom tailback Emilio Martinez, struck for four overpowering touchdowns in the first half. Martinez accounted for three of the team's five touchdowns, sprinting into the end zone in a variety of ways, including a screen pass and an inside run.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings turned the ball over to the Chieftains four times, which continuously crushed any hopes of a Vikings rally. Despite the team's continuous struggles, Hull feels that the team is making improvements and is playing better than what the score might indicate.\r\n\r\n\"We played hard,\" Hull said. \"The first half was closer than what the scoreboard said. The second half we played pretty well actually. We battled and that's all you can really ask for.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will host the Wilcox High School Chargers (2-1, 0-0) for their first division game of the season at 7 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 3 at Hod Ray Field.","excerpt":"Despite starting a different quarterback, the Palo Alto High School football team (1-3, 0-0) was unable to snap out of a two-game scoring drought, falling to the Palma High School Chieftains (4-0, 0-0) 35-7 on Friday night.

The local duo consists of Palo Alto High School seniors Sally Wang and Fabian Gardu\u00f1o, who joined forces after working on solo projects previously.\r\n\r\n\"The Striped Sea EP\" debuted on Sept. 18 performing selections from the album during lunch on the Paly Quad that day.\r\n\r\nDespite having\u00a0formed only recently, the duo has been successful, releasing two singles,\u201cEvaporate\u201d and \u201cSurvive,\u201d which are both featured on its EP. \"Evaporate\" has received 1,145 listens on Soundcloud and \"Survive\" has received 980 listens so far, with the views increasing every day. They are currently in the top 20 charts under electronic music for <a href=\"http:\/\/paperislands.bandcamp.com\/\">bandcamp<\/a>, an online music store that allows consumers to set their own price. Paper Islands has also performed at The Palo Alto Teen Arts Council's open mic nights, Battle of the Bands and other local gigs around the Bay Area.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_74673\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"326\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/10370561_1010207329005614_470440216_n1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-74673\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/10370561_1010207329005614_470440216_n1.jpg\" alt=\"Wang and Gardu\u00f1o pose for a selfie while listening to friends who are in the band &quot;Forever For a Second.&quot;\" width=\"326\" height=\"440\" \/><\/a> Wang and Gardu\u00f1o show their excitement by posing for a selfie while listening to friends who are in the band \"Forever For a Second.\" Photo by Sally Wang.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTheir music is a combination of indie and electronic, also known as electro indie.\r\n\r\nThe first song titled \u201c&amp;\u201d provides listeners with a simple melody with vocals by Wang. The lyrics send the message to be yourself and not care about what others think of you. \"&amp;\" captures the essence of a short and sweet song, but with a big message.\r\n\r\nThe album continues, with the next song, \u201ci miss you.\u201d The song is a personal story of Paper Islands that they wanted to share with the public. The track uniquely incorporates a real-life breakup phone call between a girl leaving for college and her then-boyfriend and emphasizes the obstacles of having a long-distance relationship.\r\n\r\nThe conversation, according to Gardu\u00f1o, was recorded through a phone conference with permission. It's full of emotion and all about the true feelings one gets when one has to let go to someone special in one's life. The song is enhanced by sounds of the airport at the beginning and end of the song along with the phone conversation. Wang does an excellent job vocally, showcasing the emotions of desperation and sadness through her voice, to capture and embody what one feels during a breakup.\r\n\r\nThe final song, titled \u201cSurvive\u201d was written and produced with Paly senior Will Kast. \u201cSurvive\u201d is the perfect ending to the duo\u2019s EP album. The hook is sampled from the National Nuclear Emergency Alert, which one would hear if the United States was under nuclear attack. To dramatize the song, a beat instantly drops once the message is over, and Wang's vocals comes in with the beat. Even though the EP was released only a week ago, I've already found myself singing and humming along to the catchy tune.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_74563\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/photo-11.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-74563\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/photo-11.png\" alt=\"Paper Islands performs on Sept. 5 at the Lucie Stern Community Center put on by Teen Art's Council.

Wang adds that the ocean's constant changes inspire the duo's music.\r\n\r\nThe EP can be played and downloaded above from the bandcamp, with a\u00a0set-your-own price policy.

But with the recent rise of cancer-based movies and TV shows, I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of what Hollywood thinks it\u2019s like to live with cancer:\r\n\r\nYou live a pretty decent life. You get diagnosed with cancer. You feel like your life is over. You suddenly appreciate life so much more now that you know your days are numbered. You die a tragic, beautiful death.\r\n\r\nThe summer blockbuster \u201cThe Fault In Our Stars,\u201d based on the soul-wrenching young-adult novel by John Green, spotlighted the topic of cancer and became the trailblazer for several other shows revolving around cancer and similar life threatening diseases.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed the ups and downs of the Hazel-Gus timeline in \u201cTFIOS;\" it\u2019s the unrealistic portrayal of the disease from the shows that succeed it that confounds me.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s great that mainstream entertainment is bringing attention to such a serious issue, but the border-line glamorization of cancer is getting out of hand.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the new Fox dramedy \u201cRed Band Society,\u201d which premiered at 9 p.m. last week, gives viewers a questionable image of life with serious medical issues. This new series tells the story of a diverse group of teen hospital patients bound together by the common trait of being seriously ill. (\u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d much?)\r\n\r\nThese teens try to make the best of their not-so-glamorous life at the hospital, smoking pot in deserted rooms and buying alcohol underage. In one scene of the pilot episode, they throw a \u201cgoodbye party\u201d for the leg of a surgery-bound teen, practically singing Kumbaya in a circle on the hospital rooftop. Granted, there are a few touching moments, like when the one-legged main character tearfully reminisces his presurgery life or when the sharp-tongued nurse shows compassion by ordering pizza for one of the kids. (It\u2019s a long story.) For the most part, \u201cRed Band Society\u201d is a heart-warming series but there is definitely room for improvement in terms of the plot line.\r\n\r\nWhat this show \u2014 like a couple others \u2014 fails to touch on is the painful side of cancer. Shows focus on clich\u00e9 aspects such as love triangles, friend drama and other basic components of a hit teen story instead of bringing light to the reality of the situation. The colossal range of emotions, the sporadic feelings of nausea, the hair\/weight\/appetite loss, the seemingly endless tests and the side effects of whatever medication a patient needs to take may all be a part of a cancer patient\u2019s life \u2014 a part that is not included in the said TV show. While it\u2019s okay that producers hold an optimistic view, the show\u2019s misleading take on life with cancer raises eyebrows.\r\n\r\nAs the narrator of \u201cRed Band Society\u201d so brilliantly says, \u201cEverybody thinks that when you go to a hospital, life stops. But it\u2019s just the opposite \u2014 life starts.\u201d The TV show makes it seem like having a serious illness is a great life changing experience. It gives the perception that having cancer is a blessing in disguise, a way for people to truly understand the meaning of life. People need to understand that their \u201clife\u201d can \u201cstart\u201d even without being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness and being chained to a hospital bed.\r\n\r\nCancer is not beautiful. Cancer is not the ID that lets you get past the bouncer of the exclusive learn-the-value-of-life club. Cancer should not be romanticized. And most of all, the gravity of cancer should not be downplayed simply for the sake of appealing to teenagers across the nation.","excerpt":"A summer blockbuster pioneers a new genre in mainstream entertainment.
