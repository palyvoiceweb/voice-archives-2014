Photo by Amy Leung.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nRecently, students have been taking a WASC survey in their English classes. But many students find themselves wondering: what is WASC?\r\n\r\nAccording to the Palo Alto High School WASC Coordinator and Spanish teacher Emily Garrison, WASC stands for the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.\r\n\r\n\u201cWASC is a non-profit organization,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cIt works very closely with the California Department of Education, but it doesn\u2019t have any other affiliations besides that really.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat exactly does WASC do then?\r\n\r\n\u201cIn order to make your transcript valid for college, we have to be WASC accredited,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cEverybody wants to have WASC accreditation because basically what that says is the coursework, what\u2019s happening on campus, is valid.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe surveys administered in English classes provide guidance for improving the school.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the end of the year, we\u2019re going to be done with one of our six-year cycles, and the reviews that students have done are going to be part of the process that we go through in deciding how well the school has done and where we can move on from this point,\u201d said junior Molly Kraus, a member of the student WASC group.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur job is to do two things \u2014\u00a0what\u2019s Paly doing really well?\u201d Garrison said. \u201cWe really are an amazing school. But with any school, or with any student or any person, even if that person is amazing, there\u2019s still always things that you can improve upon. So that\u2019s the second part of WASC.\u201d\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Paly WASC group is finishing up the last cycle and starting a new one, according to Garrison. Students, parents and staff discussed the big pictures of what\u2019s going on at Paly at the most recent focus group meetings.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe really analyze that [information] and we think about it,\" Garrison said.\u00a0\"Then what we\u2019re going to do is put it in a much larger context and say OK, we want to try to focus in on three to five major goals.\u00a0We don\u2019t know what those are yet \u2014\u00a0we\u2019re not quite\u00a0there yet, but we\u2019ll be there soon. In the next month or so, those goals should be developed.\"\r\n\r\nAfter creating these goals, Garrison says that the next step is a commitment to working towards those objectives for the next six years until the next WASC cycle. For the time being, the group is gathering as much data as possible.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll this stuff we\u2019re doing right now goes into a big report that\u2019s probably going to be about 300 pages long,\" Garrison said. \"It\u2019ll be finished probably by the end of December. And then that whole report of those two big pieces \u2014 what does Paly look like and then how can we improve \u2014\u00a0that can then get sent to WASC.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter reading the Paly WASC\u00a0report, WASC will send a team in early March to validate the information.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey [WASC] are here to help support us,\" Garrison said. \"And they\u2019re going to be on campus, they\u2019re going to be in classes, they\u2019re going to want to talk to students.\u201d\r\n\r\nGarrison says that this month will be important for WASC updates because it's the starting point for the new cycle of this upcoming year.\r\n\r\n\"In the next month, things are really going to start getting interesting with WASC,\" Garrison said. \"We just want to make things better for students.\"","excerpt":"WASC is beginning its new six-year cycle this upcoming school year.

Infographic created by Lizzie Chun, Saba Moussavian and Nika Woodfill.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Associated Student Body will host a week-long intramural volleyball tournament starting Sept. 22 on the Palo Alto High School Quad.\r\n\r\nThe tournament is the first of its kind at Paly since 2003. Nineteen teams are set to compete, nine of which are comprised of only senior players.\r\n\r\nDuring the first round, four games will take place per day at lunch: two during the first half and two during the second half. Games will play to 11 points or for 10 minutes. After five points, the teams will switch sides, according to the <a title=\"Paly Volleyball Guidelines\" href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/14BJnVRpvJUlv71brY3q5OlJE0zEheHX61fhMUaMnD4w\/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">official guidelines<\/a>.\r\n\r\nPrize for the first place team is a $40 gift card to Chipotle, second place is a $20 gift card to Kirk's Burgers and third place is a $10 gift card to Jamba Juice, awarded to each member of the team, according senior Sports Commissioner Livi Musil.\r\n\r\n\u201cA fun thing to look for is definitely the names of the teams,\u201d Musil said. \u201cI love them.\u201d\r\n\r\nSophomore and player for the VolleyBallers Josh Code is excited to participate.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m most excited to have fun with my friends and my team to take home that prize,\u201d Code said.\r\n\r\nThe games will culminate in a staff versus winners game on Tuesday, Sept. 30, according to Musil.\r\n\r\nA similar tournament took place in 2003 when a group of boys claimed they could beat the girl's varsity volleyball team. The varsity girls accepted the challenge, and ASB assisted in making it a school event.\r\n\r\nMusil hopes to bring back that same energy to this highly requested event. She says the tournament will be upbeat and energetic.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust come and cheer,\u201d Musil said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be crazy and competitive and a lot of fun on the Quad watching the game. And watch out for flying volleyballs.\u201d","excerpt":"The Associated Student Body will host a week-long intramural volleyball tournament starting Sept. 22 on the Palo Alto High School Quad.","date":"2014-09-20 14:55:44","author":"Saba Moussavian","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-20-at-2.21.17-PM.png","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8496":"ASB","29099":"josh code","18387":"livi musil","9021":"quad","9120":"sports","9175":"tournament","9216":"volleyball"}},{"id":74277,"title":"Football recap: Vikings dig big hole early, drop home opener 55-14","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/20\/recap-vikings-dig-big-hole-early-drop-home-opener-55-14\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School Vikings (1-2, 0-0) were unable to overcome a sloppy first quarter start Friday night and ultimately fell to the faster and more prepared Archbishop Mitty Monarchs (1-1, 0-0) by a score of 55-14 during their regular season home opener.\r\n\r\nAfter failing to score the entire first quarter, the Vikings finally contributed to the scoreboard when senior running back Jayshawn Puckett rushed over right guard for an 11-yard score, making the score 20-7 Monarchs early in the second quarter. Puckett would later score again in the quarter on a 22-yard rush. However, Mitty senior quarterback Brett Foley kept his team in control, leading the Monarchs to a 34-14 lead at the half.\u00a0According to Puckett, the Vikings started the game with a positive and ready-to-win attitude, but were rattled as Mitty's lead grew during the first half.\r\n\r\n\"I believe tonight our team came out with a mindset to win,\" Puckett said. \"But when we saw Mitty score, we let up too early and put our heads down too early and let them keep pounding the ball. We definitely have a lot of work to do especially after tonight.\"\r\n\r\nAfter both teams opened the game with punts on each of their first offensive possessions, the Monarchs scored the first of eight touchdowns when junior running back Derek Bauerle broke free from the defense for a 28-yard touchdown. Their next score occurred just one minute later, when Vikings junior quarterback Oliver Svirsky's bootleg pass was intercepted by senior defensive back Adam Acevedo, who returned the ball 33 yards for a pick-six. The Monarchs offense would tack on more points before the end of the first quarter, putting the Vikings down 20 points after just twelve minutes of play.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_74319\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"800\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/LRP_03531.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-74319\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/LRP_03531.jpg\" alt=\"Jayshawn Puckett runs for the end zone during the game against Mitty.

It just so happens we're not there yet. We will be though.\"\r\n\r\nThe second half of the game opened up with two overpowering Monarch touchdowns, eliminating any chance of a potential comeback by the Vikings, and also silencing what had been a loud and active home crowd during the first half. While the rout continued to worsen, Svirsky, who was seen throughout the second half motivating his teammates to never give up, says that the team improved from last week's 33-0 loss at San Benito in terms of overall effort.\r\n\r\n\"It's different from San Benito,\" Svirsky said. \"San Benito we beat ourselves and gave up.

This could also account partially for the change in your school's rank for this year.\"\r\n\r\nThe Beating the Odds ranking assesses performance while taking into account of socio-economic statuses of students, according to Bromberg.\r\n\r\n\"We wanted to control for student poverty levels, which are known to impact students' performance in school, so we ran this separate analysis,\" Bromberg said. \"[We] measured performance while controlling for poverty levels, using the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch.\"\r\n\r\nOther ranked schools in the Bay Area include Henry M.

One of the locations has been the intersection of North California Avenue and Bryant Street, a common junction for Palo Alto High School\u00a0bikers.\r\n\r\nAccording to the <a title=\"PAPD Facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PaloAltoPolice\/photos\/a.349604361742034.72544.288613124507825\/736025323099934\/?type=1&amp;theater\" target=\"_blank\">PAPD<\/a>, \"Operation Safe Passage\" will run through tomorrow morning and after school commute hours.\r\n\r\nPaly students have had mixed feelings about the new type of initiative the police has been taking on.\r\n\r\n\"Right now, they [the PAPD] are sparking a lot of resentment within the students who they want to be keeping safe,\u201d junior Griffin Carlson said.\r\n\r\nCarlson says\u00a0that there are better alternatives to educate students in bicycle safety.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey should have a stand or something which provides information about bicycle safety and gives out helmets instead of giving out tickets unnecessarily for one week out of the whole year,\u201d Carlson\u00a0said.\r\n\r\nOfficers ticketed a student\u00a0on Tuesday morning for having both earbuds in while biking. The student, however, said she never knew it was a violation to bike with two earbuds in.\r\n\r\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s kind of hard to obey rules you don\u2019t even know exist,\" the student said.\r\n\r\nAccording to the student, punishments can include traffic school or fines anywhere from $100 to $200.\r\n\r\nHowever, some feel that \"Operation Safe Passage\"\u00a0is a great way to bring awareness to bicycle safety.\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really followed the rules all the time, and I think they [the PAPD] don\u2019t give enough awareness to bike safety,\u201d another student said.\r\n\r\nShe said she\u00a0almost got into an accident over the weekend after not\u00a0for not coming to a complete stop at the stop sign. In response, the student will be participating in a traffic school for bicycle safety.\r\n\r\n\u201cHonestly, I think I need that class,\u201d the student said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Police Department is participating in project \"Operation Safe Passage\" throughout this week in order to elevate student biker awareness in Palo Alto.","date":"2014-09-18 19:00:21","author":"Ido Gal","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/anant-photo.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"9669":"bike","10040":"Griffin Carlson","29029":"operation safe passage","13030":"PAPD","9000":"police","29030":"tamari Dzotsenidze"}},{"id":74109,"title":"Palo Alto plans to expand crosstown shuttle route","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/18\/palo-alto-plans-to-expand-crosstown-shuttle-route\/","content":"<p>[caption id=\"attachment_74120\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/photo-2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-74120\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/photo-2.jpg\" alt=\"The Palo Alto shuttle will be expanding its routes.
