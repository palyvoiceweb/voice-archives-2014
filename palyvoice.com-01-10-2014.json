Because robotics is a year-long extracurricular, some tournaments early in the school year, like the upcoming one, occur without any added new members.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery year we give out applications just for some contact information and reaching out to people and asking them why they\u2019re interested in joining the team,\u201d Kokontis said.\r\n\r\nSophomore Kenny Cheng, the team's official offseason competition manager, reiterated that applicants are not required to have any previous experience with robotics.\r\n\r\n\"We want people who are dedicated,\" Cheng said.\u00a0 \"We don't care if they don't know anything [about robotics]: as long as they show up every time, they'll learn stuff and they'll become a part of the team.\"\r\n\r\nThe deadline for turning in applications for the team this year is Oct. 2.\u00a0 Applicants can turn in their information to the Robotics Lab or CL-2.\r\n\r\nThe CalGames will be from 3:15 p.m. to 8:45 p.m. on Friday and 7 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Saturday.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School\u2019s robotics team will look to improve on its previous performances as it prepares for the second tournament of the school year this weekend.","date":"2014-09-30 13:57:53","author":"Wesley Woo","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/robotics.jpeg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"29487":"CalGames","29488":"new members","29484":"palo alto high school robotics","29485":"paly robotics","29486":"paly robotics team","9049":"robotics","29489":"robotics applications","25084":"robotics team","9175":"tournament"}},{"id":75102,"title":"APPetite blog: Duolingo","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/30\/appetite-blog-duolingo\/","content":"<em>Here is the first installment of APPetite featuring Duolingo.

I originally downloaded to see how much Spanish I remembered since I'm not taking the class this year. Foreign language has never been my fort\u00e9, but Duolingo made it surprisingly fun. The cute green owl that guides you through all the lessons is an extra bonus.\r\n\r\nThe test-out option is also nice because it allowed me to skip the beginning lessons that I already knew. However, as I progressed through the levels, I found myself getting so absorbed in the game aspect of Duolingo that I ended up using Google Translate so I could test out of as many sections as possible. Not quite the point of the app, but you get the idea.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint is that Duolingo does not teach grammar rules. It will teach you specific verbs, but it doesn't show you a general conjugation chart. Duolingo definitely seems most effective if you use it in conjunction with a class or for a language you have a little background in.\r\n\r\nOverall, Duolingo is great.

But when the job was put off for the next two to three years, I asked Principal Kim Diorio if we could find a donor, and she did.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly\u00a0administration members, including Diorio, became aware of issues with the old furniture after using it themselves\u00a0last year.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were a number of teachers who became students for a day,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cDiorio said she sat for an hour in our comfortable chairs pretending to be a student and she realized it was just a really tough place to be. The furniture didn\u2019t work, so she understood the need before any other administrator.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents have mostly enjoyed the new look and feel of the library.\r\n\r\n\u201cI really like some of the new seats,\u201d senior Ken Shin said. \u201cThey\u2019re very comfortable, and they\u2019re much nicer than what we had last year.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly\u00a0chose the furniture through a selection process in order to create an ideal library environment for students, according to Kellerman.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe talked to Shelly Young from Workplace Connections who [designed] the Media Arts Center furniture,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cI also talked to another company that specializes in library furniture called Demco. We got samples in from both vendors, and kids sat in the chairs and did polls. ...\u00a0We ended up going with Shelly Young\u2019s design because we were able to get [more of a]\u00a0variety of colors, and the tables were more flexible.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe library features some new types of furnitures, including caf\u00e9 high tables, designed to encourage collaboration, as well as single desks with dividers.\r\n\r\n\"I like the dividers,\" junior Ophir Sneh said. \"The library can be pretty distracting sometimes, so they help keep me focused.\"\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of the new furniture \u00a0is its\u00a0compatibility.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the furniture in the Media Arts Center is the same, so it\u2019s all interchangeable.\u201d Kellerman said.","excerpt":"After delaying the remodeling of the Palo Alto High School Library, Paly administration is encouraging students to use the new furniture put in place as compensation.","date":"2014-09-29 17:23:33","author":"Ido Gal","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/10410821_854293477923970_8433335301805375494_n.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"21437":"bond","8616":"construction","21438":"delay","11130":"furniture","21439":"Kellerman","8848":"Library","8912":"new"}},{"id":74066,"title":"Local nonprofit invites community to &#8220;step out of your world&#8221;","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/29\/local-nonprofit-invites-community-to-step-out-of-your-world\/","content":"The Global Lives Project, a San Francisco-based nonprofit organization,\u00a0will exhibit an interactive video display focused on broadening cross-cultural understanding and empathy during the week-long\u00a0grand opening of the Palo Alto High School Media Arts Center starting Oct. 13.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_74683\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"400\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_7620.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-74683\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_7620.jpg\" alt=\"David Harris, Executive Director of Global Lives, explains the purpose of the Global Lives Project to Palo Alto High School staff at a faculty meeting.

All tours are scheduled to\u00a0last about 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with curriculum design professor Denise Pope from the Stanford University School of Eduation, Global Lives\u00a0also developed a teaching curriculum called \"Unheard Stories\" for middle and high school students. It is aligned with the English and history Common Core standards and consists of three parts: Understanding Myself, Barriers to Understanding and Understanding Others.\r\n\r\nSome Paly teachers have integrated\u00a0the curriculum into their classes, including the Social Justice Pathway.\r\n\r\n\"Erin [Angell] and I used it [the curriculum] in our Social Justice Pathway to give kids an opportunity to think about who they are and what influences them and then give them the chance to look into the lives of others,\" Bloom said.\r\n\r\nHarris encourages the use of the Global Lives website, which includes some of the exhibit videos, biographies of participants and an interactive map that shows connections between participants, to supplement the curriculum.\r\n\r\nPart of the Global Lives Project exhibit is currently on display at the local think tank Institute for the Future in downtown Palo Alto.\r\n\r\nHarris is looking forward to the project\u00a0being displayed\u00a0in the MAC.\r\n\r\n\"I have to say, this [the MAC] is one of the most exciting spaces I've had to work with in a long time,\" Harris said. \"Between your [Paly's] 14 different screens built into the walls here and the eight screens Global Lives will be bringing in ... this will be the first place we've ever shown all 20 of the Global Lives videos ... so this is a really cool opportunity for me as a filmmaker and artist, as well.\"","excerpt":"The Global Lives Project, a San Francisco-based nonprofit organization, will exhibit an interactive video display focused on broadening cross-cultural understanding and empathy during the week-long grand opening of the Palo Alto High School Media Arts Center starting Oct. 13.","date":"2014-09-29 17:20:55","author":"Lizzie Chun","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_7620.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"29316":"curriculum","29220":"david evan harris","29219":"david harris","29221":"denise pope","29026":"exhibit","29025":"global lives","29222":"global lives project","18366":"mac","11127":"media arts center","8944":"palo alto high school","29027":"project","9653":"stanford","29028":"unheard stories"}},{"id":75059,"title":"What&#8217;s in my bag: Dorothy Han","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/29\/whats-in-my-bag-dorothy-han\/","content":"<code><iframe src=\"\/\/www.thinglink.com\/card\/573253626114342914\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/code>\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice went around asking students what they have in their bag in order to find out more about who they are.

Hull, a team captain, braved through several rough hits and instigated a few solid drives for the Vikings. Head coach Jake Halas credits Hull's work ethic and attitude every game to the quarterback switch.\r\n\r\n\"<span style=\"color: #3e454c;\">He's a gamer,\" Halas said after the loss. \"That's why he's in there at quarterback.
