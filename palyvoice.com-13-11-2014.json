I told my players that if the projections are correct, we just keep playing until we lose.\"\r\n\r\nDuring last week's blow-out loss against Milpitas, several players were disciplined with minimal playing time due to a lack of focus and commitment during practice over the course of the past few weeks. Junior running back and linebacker Tak Nishi is excited to have key players back for Friday's big game.\r\n\r\n\"I'm happy to have the guys we didn't have last week back to play our final regular season game and get to the playoffs,\" Nishi said. \"This game will decide if we go to CCS or not, so we'll be working hard this week in practice to get the win.\"\r\n\r\nHalas agreed with Nishi on the importance of practicing hard.\r\n\r\n\"I need 100 percent attendance, participation, dialed-in mentality and focus this week,\" Halas said. \"That's what I really want. We have to have that. One hundred percent attendance in practice. We still have not had that consistently this year. I want to see a strong work week.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings and Falcons kick off at 7 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 14, at Saratoga High School.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School football team (3-6, 2-3) will look to finish out its regular season with a critical victory when it faces the Saratoga High School Falcons (4-5, 2-3) this Friday on the road with potential Central Coast Section playoff implications at stake.

Nearly 1,000 downloads have been recorded as of last week from the App store, according to \"Method to Madness\" programmer junior Matt Seligson.\r\n\r\n\"The most surprising part of these sales was the fact that people from such a wide variety of countries downloaded the app,\" said sophomore programmer and President of the iOS club Brian Tracy.\u00a0\"The only things I know about Uzbekistan are that it is somewhere in Asia, and that someone there appreciates Method to Madness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Method to Madness is a fun game, and I keep playing it because the board changes every time and you can keep trying to get a bigger score,\" junior\u00a0Zach Segal said.\r\n\r\nBoth Seligson and Tracy were shocked after receiving that amount of positive feedback.

It seems that Palo Alto High School teachers and students are making plans to adventure with friends, get ahead on work or spend the day watching Netflix. But why do we have this day off? Let's not forget the importance and austerity behind the true meaning of Veterans Day.\r\n\r\nWorld War I officially ended in June of 1919. However, the horrific fighting actually stopped after an armistice was signed by the Allied nations and Germany months earlier. Guess when this armistice went into effect. \u00a0The 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month <span style=\"color: #545454;\">\u2014<\/span>\u00a0the beginning of Veterans Day as we know it today.\r\n\r\nIn November of 1919, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed that Nov. 11 should be forevermore revered as Armistice Day. According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.va.gov\/opa\/vetsday\/vetdayhistory.asp\">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs<\/a>, President Wilson said, \"To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country\u2019s service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of the nations...\"\r\n\r\nThe name changed after World War II in which\u00a0the largest amount of soldiers, marines and airmen were deployed in national history. Since then, Nov. 11 was officially renamed to Veterans Day to commemorate all American veterans who represented their country in a time of war.\r\n\r\nSo let's stop complaining that Veterans Day falls on a Tuesday this year and that we didn't have Monday off as well. Veterans Day should not be about the long weekend. It should be about remembering and honoring those who have committed and given their lives in the name of our country.\r\n\r\nYesterday the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Robert McDonald, announced a major restructuring of the VA department. These plans come in response to an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/va-moves-to-fire-4-senior-executives-due-to-scandal\/\">incident<\/a>\u00a0that left over a hundred thousand veterans waiting painstakingly long for access to healthcare, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2014\/11\/10\/politics\/va-reforms-and-restructuring\/index.html\">CNN<\/a>. Veterans, even with their hard work for our country, often fall through the cracks of employment or healthcare when they return home.\r\n\r\nYes, it is nice to have a day off. However, we should not ignore the true intent behind this day in history. I encourage all to take a break from catching up on their favorite shows or doing homework on Tuesday to be thankful for those who have dedicated their lives to protect ours. Don't just take this free time for granted, because the soldiers we commemorate did not always have that luxury.","excerpt":"People look forward to a random day with no work and no school as extra time to relax.

The grief caused by these incidents reverberates similar feelings across the community after the loss of individuals in a series of teen suicides in 2009. The Paly Voice staff sends its hearts out to all those affected by the loss in our community. It seems all too often that students, teachers, administrators and family members are mourning for the loss of a young community member. The Paly Voice shares its suggestions for making suicide prevention and mental health recovery a top priority for every person in the community.\r\n\r\nBut first, let\u2019s consider some background information. It is impossible to pinpoint one main reason for the cause of suicide in teenagers. However, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.afsp.org\/understanding-suicide\/key-research-findings\">American Foundation for Suicide Prevention<\/a> points to mental disorders, medical conditions, pain and environmental stressors such as academic stress and pressure as the most probable causes of suicide. It is important to note that suicide is not an issue unique to our school district. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.save.org\/\">Suicide Awareness Voices of Education<\/a>, an individual dies by suicide every 13 minutes in the United States.\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"overflow-y: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/magic.piktochart.com\/embed\/3427051-untitled-infographic\" width=\"600\" height=\"394\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nSecond, although no direct cause of suicide is known, our community and district have taken various measures to change both Gunn and Palo Alto High School\u2019s climates in the last few years. In <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/print\/story\/2009\/08\/28\/amid-fear-of-another-suicide-vows-of-vigilance\">2009<\/a>, it was suggested and enforced that the \"Living Skills\" course, a required class for high schoolers in the Palo Alto Unified School District, include mental health education. In the same year, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/id\/33574154\/ns\/us_news-life\/t\/anguish-over-calif-teen-suicides-spurs-action\/#.VFsOdoekQig\">NBC News<\/a>, students from Gunn came together to post optimistic notes around campus, create peer-run support groups and distribute T-shirts with the message \u201cTalk to Me.\u201d This year, Caltrain created a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.caltrain.com\/riderinfo\/safety_security\/Suicide_Prevention.html\">suicide prevention webpage<\/a> that includes a crisis hotline number and links to local, regional and national resources. Local organizations aimed at preventing suicides, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.psnpaloalto.com\/\">Project Safety Net<\/a>, have been revamped to move forward with their mission statement of ensuring the well-being of youths. A team of healthcare professionals in the Bay Area, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.heardalliance.org\/\">HEARD Alliance<\/a>, makes it its goal to enhance the community\u2019s ability to respond to adolescent depression.\r\n\r\nAlthough our community has proposed and implemented measures for changes that have increased suicide awareness and the importance of emotional health, there are several other key suggestions that The Paly Voice would like to bring to light in the need for suicide prevention within our community.\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Remove the stigma around counseling<\/strong>\r\n\r\nDespite the excellent range of counseling services at both Paly and Gunn, students can feel reluctant to receive counseling or discouraged to improve their mental health because of a stigma surrounding counseling. This stigma leads to students who often feel that counseling can only be utilized by severely upset or mentally ill students. However, the American Counseling Services study shows that 80 percent of adolescents seen by counselors five or more times improved their level of functioning.\r\n\r\nA method to remove this stigma includes the refinement of strategies by school board members along with high school administration teams to more effectively offer help for students, with the assurance that students receive this help when needed. One way to go about doing so is by redefining the connections formed between students and counselors.\r\n\r\nWe urge students to form relationships with their advisors, guidance counselors or teachers so that in a time of need, students will have a trusted adult to speak with and confide in.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice believes that each student should receive a call slip for a brief meeting sometime throughout the year with an advisor or a guidance counselor. This would allow the student to become acclimated to an adult on campus and to become informed about the various counseling services offered. It is essential to have students feel welcomed and safe on campus, and with more exposure to an adult through individual meetings, these relationships can be formed.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Ensure guidance counselors are familiar faces on campus<\/strong>\r\n\r\nA secondary method to improve the connection between students and on-campus adults is by ensuring guidance counselors, those in charge of helping students through social emotional support, have a greater presence on campus. Currently each guidance counselor spends one lunch a week on the Quad familiarizing themselves with the students, according to the junior class Guidance Counselor Susan Shultz. Their familiarity throughout the community should be extended through counselor-mediated discussions, whether they be at club meetings or in the theater, as this would give students a time to interact with their counselor in a comfortable, informative and relaxing environment.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Improve the community\u2019s social media presence<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWhat changes do occur, however, are fruitless unless students recognize that administration members are not the only ones who can make a change in our community. Change does not happen from top down and cooperation from the student body is necessary for any of these changes to reach their full potentials. Teamwork between the student body and district will serve to provide a safer learning environment for all.\r\n\r\nStudents can help by being mindful of their presence on social media in the event of a suicide. While family and friends may want to celebrate the deceased\u2019s life through fond posts of memories, there can be ill consequences to this well-intended gesture. According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.afsp.org\/\">American Foundation for Suicide Prevention<\/a>, there is a well-documented copycat effect of suicides, in which one suicide death may contribute to another. Social media posts that glamorize the life of an individual convey an improper message to those struggling with mental health issues. Suicide is a serious issue, and it should never be presented as an option. The Paly Voice reminds the community that it is important to remember but not glorify those lost to suicide.\r\n\r\nA safer and more positive community can be achieved through various changes by both the district <i>and <\/i>the students. No matter who you are, you can make a difference. Change begins with you.","excerpt":"Although our community has proposed and implemented measures for changes that have increased suicide awareness and the importance of emotional health, there are several other key suggestions that The Paly Voice would like to bring to light in the need for suicide prevention within our community.","date":"2014-11-10 18:50:17","author":"The Paly Voice","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/photo-3.jpg","categories":["Editorial","Spotlight"],"tags":{"32450":"counseling","32451":"destigmatize","32449":"editorial","8751":"gunn","8752":"gunn high school","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","9135":"suicide","9136":"Suicide prevention"}},{"id":78518,"title":"First day of Drowsy Chaperone musical auditions at 2:30 p.m. on Nov. 20","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/11\/10\/first-day-of-drowsy-chaperone-musical-auditions-at-230-p-m-on-nov-20\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2014-11-10 18:48:48","author":"Lizzie Chun","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":{"32571":"drowsy chaperone","19628":"musical","18258":"paly theatre","32572":"theatre department"}}]
