Welcome, one and all, to the Palo Alto High School Quad. The Quad is resilient. It is the hub of campus, a staple of daily life. But to me, what the Quad really represents is learning; it is where we as students learn to be social.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve learned quite a bit about human interaction in high school classrooms. I\u2019ve learned about humans being social creatures, about how methods of communication have changed, about social tendencies. But let\u2019s be real here: in 10 years, we\u2019re only going to remember a fraction of what we\u2019ve learned in the classroom. Learning really happens outside the classroom, places like the Quad \u2014 at parties, at friends\u2019 houses, on meaningless car rides.\r\n\r\nJust as much as the Quad facilitates, it also depreciates. As hard as I try, I will rarely stand out from my peers on this patch of grass. There is little to differentiate one Viking from the other. So I began to wonder: Why is it so hard to stand out?\r\n\r\nConformity. In order to appease others\u2019 needs, we conform. The boys and girls we were on the first day of freshman year are long-lost from the young men and women we are today. For better or worse, we\u2019ve developed new habits, met new people and changed our lifestyles.\r\n\r\nOn the Quad, we conform. So today, I ask you this: On your last day at Paly, what have you done to be noticed?\r\n\r\nBoth inside and outside the classroom, it takes more effort to stand out than to go along with what everyone else is doing. And when we try to be different, we often fail. Thus, I have learned these four years that the answer to \u201cWhat can I do to stand out\u201d is just that: make mistakes.\r\n\r\nI hate mistakes. I hate them with all my power, and you probably do too, but we have to respect them.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you about a mistake I made:\r\n\r\nOn the very first day of senior year, on this very Quad, I made the mistake of taking off my clothes and running \u2014 ever so slowly \u2014 across the grass you sit on. Sure, it\u2019ll be a good story to tell my grandchildren one day, but it was in the heat of the moment, a moment of deindividuation.\r\n\r\nAs I dealt with a two-day suspension, I realized that I had a choice. I could choose how I wanted to be different. Two roads diverged in a wood, and I decided to take the one less traveled by. When I returned to school, I made sure that I did not let that incident define me. I made the conscious decision to stand out by building relationships with the administration, fostering conversation and \u2014 with the support of Ms. Diorio \u2014 helping usher in a new wave of senior legacy.\r\n\r\nTo me, standing out means accepting the learning potential that comes with the inevitable mistakes we have made and will make. It's not the mistake itself that makes us stand out, it's the process of making sense of the past in a way that provides true learning and growth that makes us stand out.\r\n\r\nAs we begin a new chapter in our lives, we must not be afraid to make mistakes, but more importantly, we must not be afraid to learn from them. Most will conform to the stigma that their mistake binds them to. Most will be afraid of standing out.\r\n\r\nClass of 2014: In order to differentiate ourselves, we must make mistakes. Be the one to fail. In fact, I challenge you to fail. Learn from such mistakes. Defy societal expectations and stand out for the right reasons: for being innovative, for being witty, for not conforming.\r\n\r\nConformity squanders potential. Embrace the accidental potential that lies within each of us.\r\n\r\nThank you, good night and good luck.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Click here to find:\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72343&amp;preview=true\">Part I<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72345&amp;preview=true\">Part II<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72348&amp;preview=true\">Part III<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72351&amp;preview=true\">Part IV<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72354&amp;preview=true\">Part V<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72367&amp;preview=true\">Part VI<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/28\/the-speeches-that-didnt-make-it-class-of-2014-part-vii\/\">Part VII<\/a>.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice acquired the following speeches from their authors, with their authors\u2019 consent to publish.

When I started as a freshman on this campus, I immediately designated myself as a quiet, reserved, and semi-awkward adolescent who really liked to dance. I carried this identity as a shield, keeping myself restricted and closed off from other opportunities. All around me, I saw my class as a collection of labels. And I began to grow a hatred for the institution of high school, a school of classifications.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, I believed high school was about immediately identifying yourself and sticking to the hasty decision for the next four years. I never even bothered to consider that there could be more to the high school experience besides getting through as fast as possible. Rather, I\u2019ve managed to morph into a person that my freshman year self wouldn\u2019t recognize.\r\n\r\nAs a freshman, no one knew who I was. As a senior, people still don\u2019t really know who I am, but I\u2019m okay with that. It\u2019s taken me four years, but I\u2019ve come out on the other side without the label I placed on myself, alongside a class who has defied every preconceived notion I\u2019ve had of them.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s face it, Paly is tough. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. This school pushes us academically and forces us to work tirelessly in order to thrive. But Paly, whether we\u2019re aware of it or not, also shows us what we\u2019re truly capable of. This is the school that tests the limits and pushes boundaries, but ultimately turns out a graduating class each year bursting with capability, passion, anticipation, and the assurance that they are ready to take on the world. The class of 2014 is no exception. I am honored to graduate with a group of so many amazing individuals. Granted, I don\u2019t know all of you, and to be quite honest, I don\u2019t know if I like all of you either. But regardless of my personal preference, this is a class completely capable of taking on the next stage in life. And we all have this school to thank.\r\n\r\nOne of the stereotypes of being a teenager is the idea that we think we\u2019re all free and invincible. And, in some cases, we prove this to be true. But an equally significant part of being a teenager is self-doubt. The unanswered question of whether or not the person I am is the person I\u2019m supposed to be.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to think I\u2019m no longer the quiet freshman I thought I was supposed to be. Sure, I\u2019m still semi-awkward, and yes, I still like to dance. But Paly has allowed me to find a greater version of myself. Someone not afraid to yell, throw out my opinion, and tackle a challenge. Someone who can stand before you all today and sincerely say she owes it to this school for helping her get here. Thank you.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Click here to find:\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72343&amp;preview=true\">Part I<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72345&amp;preview=true\">Part II<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72348&amp;preview=true\">Part III<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72351&amp;preview=true\">Part IV<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72354&amp;preview=true\">Part V<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72367&amp;preview=true\">Part VI<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/28\/the-speeches-that-didnt-make-it-class-of-2014-part-vii\/\">Part VII<\/a>.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice acquired the following speeches from their authors, with their authors\u2019 consent to publish.

First off, I\u2019d like to thank all the faculty who have devoted countless hours to making us better and more civilized people. I\u2019d like to thank the parents who have sacrificed so much to give us opportunities to grow and expand our minds. And, most importantly, I\u2019d like to thank the class of 2014 for shaping my Paly experience and molding me into the person I have become.\r\n\r\nHere I have 5 minutes to pass down some meaningful advice and inspiration to you all. Well, I\u2019m only 17 years old. I haven\u2019t even technically graduated from high school yet! I\u2019m probably one of the least qualified people to be giving any advice. So instead of giving advice, I\u2019m going to tell some stories, and hopefully something will be gleaned from them.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, when I moved to Palo Alto, I felt like a failure. I was not very sociable, my middle school years were not particularly pleasant, maybe most people can relate, and I felt isolated and distant from my fellow classmates. I came to Paly with no real sense of who I was. I was a just a face in the crowd, exacerbated by the fact that I knew no one and nothing about the culture of Paly. I was unhappy, mainly because I hadn\u2019t found the group of people I wanted to spend time with. On Club Day, however, I signed up to join the Speech and Debate team. And suddenly, my life improved tremendously. Here I found a bunch of students, from all different grade levels, seniors to other freshmen, that I had a connection to, a common interest. I filled a gap that I hadn\u2019t even realized was there. I felt I was finally a part of something. I learned so much from this team, not only about public speaking and research, but about also life, and how life gets so much easier when you share your experiences with other people.\r\n\r\nAnd therein I learned my first valuable lesson from Paly: discovering yourself is not a singular activity. It involves the people you surround yourself with, your peers, your collaborators, your friends. When you\u2019re driving on the road that is your life, you\u2019ll have a number of blind spots. So choose good friends that will look out for your blind spots, support you unconditionally, and love you for you, and you\u2019ll be more than fine.\r\n\r\nI want to share another story. Over the summer, I had the wonderful experience of being a counselor at a summer camp for middle school students. I can safely say I understand how teachers feel when they are teaching second semester seniors. We had the challenge of injecting passion and enthusiasm into the adolescents, seeing as most of them were there because their parents signed them up. I was tired and frustrated at the time, because it was hard to motivate the students to do the activities we gave them. However, when I saw a fellow counselor bounding in from another room and how sociable and eager her charges were, it didn\u2019t take long for me to realize that my students weren\u2019t excited because I wasn\u2019t passionate about what we were doing. How could I expect them to share my enthusiasm when I had no enthusiasm to share?\r\n\r\nThose kids taught me something important. When you are passionate about what you are doing, others will share in your passion as well. This leads to a wonderful symbiosis where everyone is united in their interests. Something like Spirit Week. All it takes is for one person to start a cheer and others will follow. It is not enough to achieve your own dreams; you must inspire the dreams of others. In the case of the summer camp, I found that once I perked up, the students started perking up and their excitement and achievements were so rewarding to see. So, going forth in my life, I will take the lesson that those kids gave to me: to lead with spirit and heart, and to include those important to me in my passions.\r\n\r\nI chose these two stories because I feel they illustrate something important: choose a group of people that will inspire you, and in turn, you will inspire them. Share your passions and others will share there\u2019s. Give back to the community in any way that you can, because, after all they were the ones that made you, you. Life is not fun when you don\u2019t share it with others, something that I learned my freshman year; and I am so glad that I got to share my years at Paly with these graduates here.\r\n\r\nActually, now, that I\u2019m thinking about it, I lied at the beginning of my speech. I do have a piece of advice to give: don\u2019t forget to turn the tassel on your way down the stairs! Thank you and congratulations to the class of 2014!!\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Click here to find:\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72343&amp;preview=true\">Part I<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72345&amp;preview=true\">Part II<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72348&amp;preview=true\">Part III<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72351&amp;preview=true\">Part IV<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72354&amp;preview=true\">Part V<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72367&amp;preview=true\">Part VI<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/28\/the-speeches-that-didnt-make-it-class-of-2014-part-vii\/\">Part VII<\/a>.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice acquired the following speeches from their authors, with their authors\u2019 consent to publish.

And that\u2019s okay.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Paly, particularly the class of 2014, different, is that we have established a community that supports.\u00a0 A community that accepts the times in which we may not succeed and rejoices during the times in which we do.\u00a0 We have established a community that consists of people who are shamelessly excited to sometimes live vicariously through the successes of their fellow classmates.\u00a0 We\u2019ve won some, we\u2019ve lost some.\u00a0 But the \u201cwins\u201d of few are often celebrated by many.\u00a0 And that has made all the difference.\r\n\r\nWe are excited to read the latest articles produced by the talented students within the journalism program and are open minded to the events put on by various clubs.\r\n\r\nFans and athletes alike seem to have a feeling of victory in our hearts when the Vikings come home with a win and when Paly Rocks performs on the quad at Friday lunch, the long week of school that preceded seems to fade away and we can nod to ourselves thinking, \u201cyes, I deserve this performance\u201d and \u201cThank you Paly Rocks.\u00a0 You win for providing us with this music.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur class has won spirit week. We have also lost.\u00a0 How many times? I guess that might just be something that we keep to ourselves.\u00a0 But if it weren\u2019t for Audrey and Kate working as hard as they could all week long, each year, I don\u2019t know how we would\u2019ve pulled off what we did.\r\n\r\nAnd while those memories might fade for some of us, the one thing that will never seem to go away is the community we have made here.\u00a0 It\u2019s cliche and sounds like it came off of a Hallmark card but it\u2019s how I feel.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s fantastic that here, on the day of my high school graduation, I don\u2019t need to fake any sort of sincere happiness and pride.\u00a0 I don\u2019t need to casually say, \u201cYou win some; you lose some\u201d to disguise any feeling of regret or indifference.\r\n\r\nBecause today I am standing next to downright hardworking people.\u00a0 I am among people who have already started and sold their own companies, people who have brought Paly it\u2019s first TEDx conference, people who produce their own music, people who have started their own clubs, someone who has represented our country at the Olympic games, and someone who has represented our country on the national physics team.\u00a0 I am standing among people who have plans to travel the world, people who have plans to pursue their passions, people who have plans to continue learning, and people who might not have any plans at all quite yet.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exciting too.\r\n\r\nI haven\u2019t scored a touchdown, I haven\u2019t won an election, I haven\u2019t been in charge of a publication, and I haven\u2019t won any academic awards.\u00a0 My greatest level of participation in organized activity at Paly was co-leading the spirit dance and being a part of the marching band at football games.\r\n\r\nBut even so, I have experienced a community that has made me feel supported and I have been genuinely excited to watch my classmates pursue their academic, athletic, artistic, political, and social goals.\u00a0 Most importantly, I am a part of a class that has made me feel like I can be a part of it all.\u00a0 Whatever it may be.\r\n\r\nI stand here today, looking back on the past four years I\u2019ve spent with these amazing 481 people, knowing now more than ever, that in reality I have won a whole lot and really lost nothing at all.\r\n\r\nThank you, Class of 2014.\u00a0 And Congratulations.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Click here to find:\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72343&amp;preview=true\">Part I<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72345&amp;preview=true\">Part II<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72348&amp;preview=true\">Part III<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72351&amp;preview=true\">Part IV<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72354&amp;preview=true\">Part V<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72367&amp;preview=true\">Part VI<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/28\/the-speeches-that-didnt-make-it-class-of-2014-part-vii\/\">Part VII<\/a>.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice acquired the following speeches from their authors, with their authors\u2019 consent to publish.

Thank you all so much for being in attendance today to celebrate the achievements of the graduating class of 2014. My name is Yumi Temple, and I am a proud member of this graduating class, to whom I address this message.\r\n\r\nWe live in a world with numerous problems: poverty, global warming, and war are just the start. In the face of such daunting issues, some may conclude that we must wait until we\u2019re older to impact our world. However, I respectfully disagree. When I look at this class, I see a passion for the betterment of this world, that outshines any inexperience, and a certain shameless optimism that makes me believe in our power for change. I see individuals alive with an irrepressible exuberance for change, and I see this zeal every day, in a classmate\u2019s compassion towards autistic children or in another\u2019s pursuit of gender equality. I \ufb01rmly believe that each of us has a passion and a gift that we must give back, no matter our age or experience: and the beautiful thing is that we get to witness this process of giving back every day.\r\n\r\nEach day, my classmates give their gifts back to our community through tutoring, volunteer work at animal shelters and senior centers, involvement in athletics, and in congratulating a friend on beating 2048 and more. Every day, small gifts of kindness, determination, and knowledge are given and reciprocated. The gifts we\u2019ve given back show how much we already impact our world, despite our inexperience. As young as we are, we make a difference to each other, and even better than witnessing the amazing gifts and passions of my classmates, is knowing that as we take up the mantle of responsibility as adults within our society, our impact will only grow, until perhaps one day, we solve the problems of this age.\r\n\r\nOne of my inspirations is The Dalai Lama, and he said \u201cIn order to carry a positive action, we must develop here a positive vision,\u201d and my vision for the future is overwhelmingly positive, where the young adults of today grow into the adults of tomorrow, and never lose the vivacity and inspiration that makes them an integral component of change in our world. We have the potential to do great things in the\r\nfuture, but also the ability to do those things now. Looking at all of you today, that present potential is evident. I\u2019m so proud of everything we\u2019ve achieved together, and so excited to see what effects our individual gifts and passions will have on the world.\r\n\r\nThank you for everything you\u2019ve taught me, and congratulations to the Class of 2014\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Click here to find:\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72343&amp;preview=true\">Part I<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72345&amp;preview=true\">Part II<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72348&amp;preview=true\">Part III<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72351&amp;preview=true\">Part IV<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72354&amp;preview=true\">Part V<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72367&amp;preview=true\">Part VI<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/28\/the-speeches-that-didnt-make-it-class-of-2014-part-vii\/\">Part VII<\/a>.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice acquired the following speeches from their authors, with their authors\u2019 consent to publish.

The views stated in these speeches do not necessarily reflect the views of <em>The Paly Voice, <\/em>nor those of its staff.\r\n\r\n<strong>Graduation Speech<\/strong>\r\n\r\nby Travis Chen\r\n\r\nHello friends, teachers, parents, and grandparents of 2014 - I\u2019m honored to speak in front of all of you today; it\u2019s been quite a ride. If you were expecting a forward-looking, philosophically dense, and mature recollection of our potential for the future, I apologize in advance, because today, I invite us to take the magic school bus ride back in time.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who aren\u2019t in line with the debacle we know as Facebook, Paly had a competition first semester to determine who had the best statuses of 2008-2010, the dark ages known as middle school. For the sake of minimizing embarrassment for those brave individuals who submitted statuses, I\u2019ll maintain anonymity, but I do want to share a few highlights: \u201cWhen life hands u crap make crap-aid\u201d [pause] \u00a0\u201cHow the [F] do people get such high scores in doodle jump\u201d [pause] \u201cgive me farm-ville presents!!\u201d [pause] \u00a0\u201cI'm peeing myself\u201d [pause]\u00a0\u201cYes!! Over 200 friends!!\u201d [pause] My god!\u00a0\u201cterrible star test scores. I\u2019m so mad! :( \u201c [pause] \u201cMerry Christmas people!!! OMG Santa\u2019s gonna break into my house in a couple hours!!! YAYYAYAYAYA!!!!\u201d who by the way was already a <em>freshman<\/em> by the time he wrote this. [pause] \u201cmy mom just counted 27 dog poops, guess my brother and sis haven\u2019t really been doing their job\u201d [pause] and my personal favorite \u201cvia Jonas Brothers Live Video Chat. If u cud go enywhere in the world wher wud u go?\u201d <em>\u2013 By the way, <\/em><em>seniors, I\u2019m sorry if I haven\u2019t chosen yours, I promise I still think whatever you said was hilarious.<\/em> This, I believe, captures the true spirit and mysteries of youth - our priorities may have shifted, from Doodlejump to SAT scores, from the Jonas Brothers and 2009 Miley Cyrus to 2014 Miley Cyrus, but the fundamental questions withstand the test of time: if you could do anything, what would you do with your life, where would you go, and who would you meet?\r\n\r\nOn the last day of our momentous Facebook contest, incidentally on the day before early apps were due, one of its organizers announced: \u201cDeadline is tonight at midnight! Do this instead of college apps! College is only 4 years, but high school popularity is forever!\u201d He\u2019s right, [pause] in some ways. As we move forward into college, work, traveling abroad, I invite us to look back at the limitless potential of our youth and what we envisioned our future to be and whether it lines up. This does not imply that we should remain stuck in our past and its exigencies, but rather that we should draw upon the same energy of our youth as the guiding spirit for the future and its boundless potential. In the same way that we think Santa, Farm-Ville, and STAR test scores are beyond us, we may one day view our frenzy for college apps, grades, and Flappy Bird as silly. But what remain eternal is our energy, curiosity, and desire to progress. From Ms. Choy\u2019s lively puns to Mr. Bungarden\u2019s <em>occasional <\/em>moments of youthful pure joy, the spirit of youth exists within all of us. Our search for what is valuable is elusive as times change what we view as important, but ultimately, this search itself is what is valuable.\r\n\r\nToday signifies the day that we move on, 4 years older than when we first stepped foot on this campus, but let\u2019s not forget to live life, doodle jump, keep dreaming, and most of all, stay young.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Click here to find:\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72343&amp;preview=true\">Part I<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72345&amp;preview=true\">Part II<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72348&amp;preview=true\">Part III<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72351&amp;preview=true\">Part IV<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72354&amp;preview=true\">Part V<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72367&amp;preview=true\">Part VI<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/28\/the-speeches-that-didnt-make-it-class-of-2014-part-vii\/\">Part VII<\/a>.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice acquired the following speeches from their authors, with their authors\u2019 consent to publish.
