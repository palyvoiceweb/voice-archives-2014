Photo by Maddy Jones.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPalo Alto High School students and faculty alike are learning to cope with the loss of parking space after construction on the new Performing Arts Center began over the summer, blocking off a portion of the Embarcadero Road parking lot.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the Performing Arts Center has taken up 107\u00a0parking spots from the Embarcadero lot, most of which were staff parking, and has caused the administration to paint 65 new staff parking spaces in the lot. Students have also gained 27 parking spaces to compensate for the loss of space in the Embarcadero Road lot; however, these spaces are on the other side of campus in the Churchill Avenue lot, where maintenance workers used to park. Once new construction for the Big Gym begins, 32 more spots will be lost from the Churchill parking lot. According to Assistant Principal Jerry Berskon, the combined construction\u00a0of both the Big Gym and the Performing Arts Center\u00a0will cause\u00a0a net loss of 112 parking spaces.\r\n\r\nDue to the reduced number of spaces this year, parking permits will first\u00a0be issued to seniors only. Seniors can pick up parking permit applications starting August 21 in the Auditor's Office, but it will be three weeks until enforcement of parking permits begins for the Paly lots, according to Berkson. The Associated Student Body, which decides the cost of a parking permit, has set the price for a parking permit at 120, as opposed to last year's price of 80 dollars.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_72583\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"229\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-72583\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-3.jpg\" alt=\"The gate to the bike path can be found behind the history 300 building.

This can be used by students to access Town and Country Village across the street. Photo by Maddy Jones.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will be seniors only to start,\" Berkson said. \"If we figure out that there\u2019s X amount left over, then we\u2019ll probably have a lottery for juniors.\u00a0Either that or other creative ideas: maybe there\u2019s Monday-Wednesday-Friday and Tuesday-Thursday parking permits. We\u2019re trying to be as fair as possible without it being crazy.\u201d\r\n\r\nBerkson added that there will probably be 32 temporary parking permits handed out as well for spots that will be taken away once the Big Gym project begins during winter break.\r\n\r\nWithin the first week of school the limited number of spots has inconvenienced many driving-aged Paly students, like senior Megan Valencia. Since enforcement of parking permits has not begun, the imbalance between the greater number of students who wish to park and parking spaces has created competition for spaces.\r\n\r\n\"I've had to change my route and go to the Churchill parking lot instead of the Embarcadero parking lot,\" Valencia said. \"Since they aren't enforcing parking permits yet, anyone can park there [in the Embarcadero parking lot] and there aren't any spots.\"\r\n\r\nConstruction for the Performing Arts Center is expected to last 18 months, which would make it end in the middle of the 2015-16 school year. Until construction is over, it is expected that parking permits will continue to be issued with senior priority, according to Berkson.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_72595\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"234\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-8.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-72595\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-8.jpg\" alt=\"New walkways have been set up to accommodate expected pedestrians and bikes coming through the parking lot.

Additionally, Berkson said that the senior-priority for parking will be dropped.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a lack of parking, the construction is also blocking off the path to the crosswalk leading to Town and Country Village. There are now two ways for students to get to the popular lunchtime destination. One alternative \u00a0is located behind the 300 building where there is a gate that leads to the bike path that connects over to Town and Country, and the other option is to go up to the main crosswalk at the Embarcadero-El Camino intersection.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_72585\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"322\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-5.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-72585\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-5.jpg\" alt=\"A new bike rack has been set up between the administration building and the Embarcadero parking lot.

At the end of these walkways and bikeways, two new bike racks have been added near the Tower\u00a0Building.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis has become more of a bike commute area than before, so they put the bike racks in there [by the Tower Building],\u201d Berkson said.\r\n\r\nWith all the new additions, Berkson stresses the importance of being alert and staying safe.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you are going to drive, be careful because it is a whole different configuration now,\" Berkson said. \"Even if you\u2019re paying attention, that doesn\u2019t mean the other people driving around are paying attention, so pay attention.\"","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School students and faculty alike are learning to cope with the loss of parking space after construction on the new Performing Arts Center began over the summer, blocking off a portion of the Embarcadero Road parking lot.","date":"2014-08-20 17:49:21","author":"Maddy Jones","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/photo-7.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8616":"construction","8690":"facilities","20206":"new theater","20205":"parking lot","20204":"parking spaces"}},{"id":72561,"title":"Freshman orientation to start at 4 p.m. on Aug. 14 in the small gym","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/07\/07\/freshman-orientation-to-start-at-4-p-m-on-aug-14-in-the-small-gym\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2014-07-07 21:24:30","author":"Lizzie Chun","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":{"20198":"freshman orientation"}},{"id":72564,"title":"School photos for sophomores, juniors and seniors to be taken on Aug. 15","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/07\/07\/school-photos-for-sophomores-juniors-and-seniors-to-be-taken-on-aug-15\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2014-07-07 21:24:09","author":"Lizzie Chun","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":{"20200":"id","20199":"school photos"}},{"id":72510,"title":"Slideshow: Graduation 2014","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/06\/02\/slideshow-graduation-2014\/","content":"The Class of 2014 graduated from Palo Alto High School Wednesday from the Quad, girls donned in white and boys in green.

The views stated in these speeches do not necessarily reflect the views of <em>The Paly Voice,<\/em> nor those of its staff.\r\n\r\n<strong>Graduation Speech<\/strong>\r\n\r\nby Hillel Zand\r\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, graduates of the class of 2014:\r\n\r\nI would like to start off by talking about where you are sitting. Welcome, one and all, to the Palo Alto High School Quad. The Quad is resilient. It is the hub of campus, a staple of daily life. But to me, what the Quad really represents is learning; it is where we as students learn to be social.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve learned quite a bit about human interaction in high school classrooms. I\u2019ve learned about humans being social creatures, about how methods of communication have changed, about social tendencies. But let\u2019s be real here: in 10 years, we\u2019re only going to remember a fraction of what we\u2019ve learned in the classroom. Learning really happens outside the classroom, places like the Quad \u2014 at parties, at friends\u2019 houses, on meaningless car rides.\r\n\r\nJust as much as the Quad facilitates, it also depreciates. As hard as I try, I will rarely stand out from my peers on this patch of grass. There is little to differentiate one Viking from the other. So I began to wonder: Why is it so hard to stand out?\r\n\r\nConformity. In order to appease others\u2019 needs, we conform. The boys and girls we were on the first day of freshman year are long-lost from the young men and women we are today. For better or worse, we\u2019ve developed new habits, met new people and changed our lifestyles.\r\n\r\nOn the Quad, we conform. So today, I ask you this: On your last day at Paly, what have you done to be noticed?\r\n\r\nBoth inside and outside the classroom, it takes more effort to stand out than to go along with what everyone else is doing. And when we try to be different, we often fail. Thus, I have learned these four years that the answer to \u201cWhat can I do to stand out\u201d is just that: make mistakes.\r\n\r\nI hate mistakes. I hate them with all my power, and you probably do too, but we have to respect them.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you about a mistake I made:\r\n\r\nOn the very first day of senior year, on this very Quad, I made the mistake of taking off my clothes and running \u2014 ever so slowly \u2014 across the grass you sit on. Sure, it\u2019ll be a good story to tell my grandchildren one day, but it was in the heat of the moment, a moment of deindividuation.\r\n\r\nAs I dealt with a two-day suspension, I realized that I had a choice. I could choose how I wanted to be different. Two roads diverged in a wood, and I decided to take the one less traveled by. When I returned to school, I made sure that I did not let that incident define me. I made the conscious decision to stand out by building relationships with the administration, fostering conversation and \u2014 with the support of Ms. Diorio \u2014 helping usher in a new wave of senior legacy.\r\n\r\nTo me, standing out means accepting the learning potential that comes with the inevitable mistakes we have made and will make. It's not the mistake itself that makes us stand out, it's the process of making sense of the past in a way that provides true learning and growth that makes us stand out.\r\n\r\nAs we begin a new chapter in our lives, we must not be afraid to make mistakes, but more importantly, we must not be afraid to learn from them. Most will conform to the stigma that their mistake binds them to. Most will be afraid of standing out.\r\n\r\nClass of 2014: In order to differentiate ourselves, we must make mistakes. Be the one to fail. In fact, I challenge you to fail. Learn from such mistakes. Defy societal expectations and stand out for the right reasons: for being innovative, for being witty, for not conforming.\r\n\r\nConformity squanders potential. Embrace the accidental potential that lies within each of us.\r\n\r\nThank you, good night and good luck.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Click here to find:\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72343&amp;preview=true\">Part I<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72345&amp;preview=true\">Part II<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72348&amp;preview=true\">Part III<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72351&amp;preview=true\">Part IV<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72354&amp;preview=true\">Part V<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72367&amp;preview=true\">Part VI<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/28\/the-speeches-that-didnt-make-it-class-of-2014-part-vii\/\">Part VII<\/a>.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice acquired the following speeches from their authors, with their authors\u2019 consent to publish.

When I started as a freshman on this campus, I immediately designated myself as a quiet, reserved, and semi-awkward adolescent who really liked to dance. I carried this identity as a shield, keeping myself restricted and closed off from other opportunities. All around me, I saw my class as a collection of labels. And I began to grow a hatred for the institution of high school, a school of classifications.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, I believed high school was about immediately identifying yourself and sticking to the hasty decision for the next four years. I never even bothered to consider that there could be more to the high school experience besides getting through as fast as possible. Rather, I\u2019ve managed to morph into a person that my freshman year self wouldn\u2019t recognize.\r\n\r\nAs a freshman, no one knew who I was. As a senior, people still don\u2019t really know who I am, but I\u2019m okay with that. It\u2019s taken me four years, but I\u2019ve come out on the other side without the label I placed on myself, alongside a class who has defied every preconceived notion I\u2019ve had of them.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s face it, Paly is tough. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. This school pushes us academically and forces us to work tirelessly in order to thrive. But Paly, whether we\u2019re aware of it or not, also shows us what we\u2019re truly capable of. This is the school that tests the limits and pushes boundaries, but ultimately turns out a graduating class each year bursting with capability, passion, anticipation, and the assurance that they are ready to take on the world. The class of 2014 is no exception. I am honored to graduate with a group of so many amazing individuals. Granted, I don\u2019t know all of you, and to be quite honest, I don\u2019t know if I like all of you either. But regardless of my personal preference, this is a class completely capable of taking on the next stage in life. And we all have this school to thank.\r\n\r\nOne of the stereotypes of being a teenager is the idea that we think we\u2019re all free and invincible. And, in some cases, we prove this to be true. But an equally significant part of being a teenager is self-doubt. The unanswered question of whether or not the person I am is the person I\u2019m supposed to be.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to think I\u2019m no longer the quiet freshman I thought I was supposed to be. Sure, I\u2019m still semi-awkward, and yes, I still like to dance. But Paly has allowed me to find a greater version of myself. Someone not afraid to yell, throw out my opinion, and tackle a challenge. Someone who can stand before you all today and sincerely say she owes it to this school for helping her get here. Thank you.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Click here to find:\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72343&amp;preview=true\">Part I<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72345&amp;preview=true\">Part II<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72348&amp;preview=true\">Part III<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72351&amp;preview=true\">Part IV<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72354&amp;preview=true\">Part V<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72367&amp;preview=true\">Part VI<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/28\/the-speeches-that-didnt-make-it-class-of-2014-part-vii\/\">Part VII<\/a>.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice acquired the following speeches from their authors, with their authors\u2019 consent to publish.

First off, I\u2019d like to thank all the faculty who have devoted countless hours to making us better and more civilized people. I\u2019d like to thank the parents who have sacrificed so much to give us opportunities to grow and expand our minds. And, most importantly, I\u2019d like to thank the class of 2014 for shaping my Paly experience and molding me into the person I have become.\r\n\r\nHere I have 5 minutes to pass down some meaningful advice and inspiration to you all. Well, I\u2019m only 17 years old. I haven\u2019t even technically graduated from high school yet! I\u2019m probably one of the least qualified people to be giving any advice. So instead of giving advice, I\u2019m going to tell some stories, and hopefully something will be gleaned from them.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, when I moved to Palo Alto, I felt like a failure. I was not very sociable, my middle school years were not particularly pleasant, maybe most people can relate, and I felt isolated and distant from my fellow classmates. I came to Paly with no real sense of who I was. I was a just a face in the crowd, exacerbated by the fact that I knew no one and nothing about the culture of Paly. I was unhappy, mainly because I hadn\u2019t found the group of people I wanted to spend time with. On Club Day, however, I signed up to join the Speech and Debate team. And suddenly, my life improved tremendously. Here I found a bunch of students, from all different grade levels, seniors to other freshmen, that I had a connection to, a common interest. I filled a gap that I hadn\u2019t even realized was there. I felt I was finally a part of something. I learned so much from this team, not only about public speaking and research, but about also life, and how life gets so much easier when you share your experiences with other people.\r\n\r\nAnd therein I learned my first valuable lesson from Paly: discovering yourself is not a singular activity. It involves the people you surround yourself with, your peers, your collaborators, your friends. When you\u2019re driving on the road that is your life, you\u2019ll have a number of blind spots. So choose good friends that will look out for your blind spots, support you unconditionally, and love you for you, and you\u2019ll be more than fine.\r\n\r\nI want to share another story. Over the summer, I had the wonderful experience of being a counselor at a summer camp for middle school students. I can safely say I understand how teachers feel when they are teaching second semester seniors. We had the challenge of injecting passion and enthusiasm into the adolescents, seeing as most of them were there because their parents signed them up. I was tired and frustrated at the time, because it was hard to motivate the students to do the activities we gave them. However, when I saw a fellow counselor bounding in from another room and how sociable and eager her charges were, it didn\u2019t take long for me to realize that my students weren\u2019t excited because I wasn\u2019t passionate about what we were doing. How could I expect them to share my enthusiasm when I had no enthusiasm to share?\r\n\r\nThose kids taught me something important. When you are passionate about what you are doing, others will share in your passion as well. This leads to a wonderful symbiosis where everyone is united in their interests. Something like Spirit Week. All it takes is for one person to start a cheer and others will follow. It is not enough to achieve your own dreams; you must inspire the dreams of others. In the case of the summer camp, I found that once I perked up, the students started perking up and their excitement and achievements were so rewarding to see. So, going forth in my life, I will take the lesson that those kids gave to me: to lead with spirit and heart, and to include those important to me in my passions.\r\n\r\nI chose these two stories because I feel they illustrate something important: choose a group of people that will inspire you, and in turn, you will inspire them. Share your passions and others will share there\u2019s. Give back to the community in any way that you can, because, after all they were the ones that made you, you. Life is not fun when you don\u2019t share it with others, something that I learned my freshman year; and I am so glad that I got to share my years at Paly with these graduates here.\r\n\r\nActually, now, that I\u2019m thinking about it, I lied at the beginning of my speech. I do have a piece of advice to give: don\u2019t forget to turn the tassel on your way down the stairs! Thank you and congratulations to the class of 2014!!\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Click here to find:\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72343&amp;preview=true\">Part I<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72345&amp;preview=true\">Part II<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72348&amp;preview=true\">Part III<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72351&amp;preview=true\">Part IV<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72354&amp;preview=true\">Part V<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72367&amp;preview=true\">Part VI<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/28\/the-speeches-that-didnt-make-it-class-of-2014-part-vii\/\">Part VII<\/a>.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice acquired the following speeches from their authors, with their authors\u2019 consent to publish.

And that\u2019s okay.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Paly, particularly the class of 2014, different, is that we have established a community that supports.\u00a0 A community that accepts the times in which we may not succeed and rejoices during the times in which we do.\u00a0 We have established a community that consists of people who are shamelessly excited to sometimes live vicariously through the successes of their fellow classmates.\u00a0 We\u2019ve won some, we\u2019ve lost some.\u00a0 But the \u201cwins\u201d of few are often celebrated by many.\u00a0 And that has made all the difference.\r\n\r\nWe are excited to read the latest articles produced by the talented students within the journalism program and are open minded to the events put on by various clubs.\r\n\r\nFans and athletes alike seem to have a feeling of victory in our hearts when the Vikings come home with a win and when Paly Rocks performs on the quad at Friday lunch, the long week of school that preceded seems to fade away and we can nod to ourselves thinking, \u201cyes, I deserve this performance\u201d and \u201cThank you Paly Rocks.\u00a0 You win for providing us with this music.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur class has won spirit week. We have also lost.\u00a0 How many times? I guess that might just be something that we keep to ourselves.\u00a0 But if it weren\u2019t for Audrey and Kate working as hard as they could all week long, each year, I don\u2019t know how we would\u2019ve pulled off what we did.\r\n\r\nAnd while those memories might fade for some of us, the one thing that will never seem to go away is the community we have made here.\u00a0 It\u2019s cliche and sounds like it came off of a Hallmark card but it\u2019s how I feel.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s fantastic that here, on the day of my high school graduation, I don\u2019t need to fake any sort of sincere happiness and pride.\u00a0 I don\u2019t need to casually say, \u201cYou win some; you lose some\u201d to disguise any feeling of regret or indifference.\r\n\r\nBecause today I am standing next to downright hardworking people.\u00a0 I am among people who have already started and sold their own companies, people who have brought Paly it\u2019s first TEDx conference, people who produce their own music, people who have started their own clubs, someone who has represented our country at the Olympic games, and someone who has represented our country on the national physics team.\u00a0 I am standing among people who have plans to travel the world, people who have plans to pursue their passions, people who have plans to continue learning, and people who might not have any plans at all quite yet.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exciting too.\r\n\r\nI haven\u2019t scored a touchdown, I haven\u2019t won an election, I haven\u2019t been in charge of a publication, and I haven\u2019t won any academic awards.\u00a0 My greatest level of participation in organized activity at Paly was co-leading the spirit dance and being a part of the marching band at football games.\r\n\r\nBut even so, I have experienced a community that has made me feel supported and I have been genuinely excited to watch my classmates pursue their academic, athletic, artistic, political, and social goals.\u00a0 Most importantly, I am a part of a class that has made me feel like I can be a part of it all.\u00a0 Whatever it may be.\r\n\r\nI stand here today, looking back on the past four years I\u2019ve spent with these amazing 481 people, knowing now more than ever, that in reality I have won a whole lot and really lost nothing at all.\r\n\r\nThank you, Class of 2014.\u00a0 And Congratulations.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Click here to find:\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72343&amp;preview=true\">Part I<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72345&amp;preview=true\">Part II<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72348&amp;preview=true\">Part III<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72351&amp;preview=true\">Part IV<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72354&amp;preview=true\">Part V<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72367&amp;preview=true\">Part VI<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/28\/the-speeches-that-didnt-make-it-class-of-2014-part-vii\/\">Part VII<\/a>.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice acquired the following speeches from their authors, with their authors\u2019 consent to publish.

Thank you all so much for being in attendance today to celebrate the achievements of the graduating class of 2014. My name is Yumi Temple, and I am a proud member of this graduating class, to whom I address this message.\r\n\r\nWe live in a world with numerous problems: poverty, global warming, and war are just the start. In the face of such daunting issues, some may conclude that we must wait until we\u2019re older to impact our world. However, I respectfully disagree. When I look at this class, I see a passion for the betterment of this world, that outshines any inexperience, and a certain shameless optimism that makes me believe in our power for change. I see individuals alive with an irrepressible exuberance for change, and I see this zeal every day, in a classmate\u2019s compassion towards autistic children or in another\u2019s pursuit of gender equality. I \ufb01rmly believe that each of us has a passion and a gift that we must give back, no matter our age or experience: and the beautiful thing is that we get to witness this process of giving back every day.\r\n\r\nEach day, my classmates give their gifts back to our community through tutoring, volunteer work at animal shelters and senior centers, involvement in athletics, and in congratulating a friend on beating 2048 and more. Every day, small gifts of kindness, determination, and knowledge are given and reciprocated. The gifts we\u2019ve given back show how much we already impact our world, despite our inexperience. As young as we are, we make a difference to each other, and even better than witnessing the amazing gifts and passions of my classmates, is knowing that as we take up the mantle of responsibility as adults within our society, our impact will only grow, until perhaps one day, we solve the problems of this age.\r\n\r\nOne of my inspirations is The Dalai Lama, and he said \u201cIn order to carry a positive action, we must develop here a positive vision,\u201d and my vision for the future is overwhelmingly positive, where the young adults of today grow into the adults of tomorrow, and never lose the vivacity and inspiration that makes them an integral component of change in our world. We have the potential to do great things in the\r\nfuture, but also the ability to do those things now. Looking at all of you today, that present potential is evident. I\u2019m so proud of everything we\u2019ve achieved together, and so excited to see what effects our individual gifts and passions will have on the world.\r\n\r\nThank you for everything you\u2019ve taught me, and congratulations to the Class of 2014\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Click here to find:\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72343&amp;preview=true\">Part I<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72345&amp;preview=true\">Part II<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72348&amp;preview=true\">Part III<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72351&amp;preview=true\">Part IV<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72354&amp;preview=true\">Part V<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/?p=72367&amp;preview=true\">Part VI<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/28\/the-speeches-that-didnt-make-it-class-of-2014-part-vii\/\">Part VII<\/a>.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice acquired the following speeches from their authors, with their authors\u2019 consent to publish.
