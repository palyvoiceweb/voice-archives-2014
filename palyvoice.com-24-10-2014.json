The five-day event can be slightly daunting, but if you plan ahead and take it a day at a time, you'll be ready to go with minimal stress.

Louder, louder than a lion.\u201d Don\u2019t be afraid to unleash your inner animal for this day. For a little inspiration, feel free to reenact the beginning scene of \"The Lion King\" by raising the smallest person you can find to the sun and yelling, \u201cIt\u2019s the circle of life.\u201d Although you may get weird looks from your friends, be sure to have confidence like the lion that you\u2019ll be dressed as.\u00a0If you are struggling with dressing up as a character from \"The Lion King,\" you\u00a0can extend the theme to all Disney characters. However, it's recommended that freshmen dress up as Lion King-specific characters. You\u00a0can wear all pink to represent a flamingo, or black and white to represent a zebra. If you\u2019re freaking out about not knowing what to wear, just remember \u201cHakuna Matata.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>[Tuesday] Dressing day <\/strong>-<strong> Healthy Choice: <\/strong>Healthy choice day is a day to dress up like the athlete you were never successful in becoming. Biking, running, lacrosse, golf or football \u2013 it's\u00a0time to pick whichever sport you please. Try to stick with one sport throughout the whole outfit, because we really don\u2019t want to see a biker\u2019s helmet with a jersey and a swimsuit bottom. If you\u2019re going for the runner\u2019s look, please keep in mind that if you wouldn\u2019t wear it on your run, don\u2019t wear it. People don\u2019t want to see your pasty thighs in the athletic shorts you'd never wear. And would you really\u00a0exercise with your hair down? We think not. To complete the look, bring a water bottle of choice \u2013 even better, have it be\u00a0orange, your class color.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Wednesday] Color day - Orange:<\/strong> Orange you glad you\u2019re a freshman? Head on over to Target or Spirit and buy a variety of orange items: tights, shorts, shirts (or wear your class shirt if you bought one), tutus, boas, sunglasses and socks. You can even buy one of those 69-cent mini pumpkins from Trader Joe's to place on your orange spray-painted head. Just remember to go all-out and find everything you can that\u2019s orange. Color day\u2019s an easy day, no matter the color.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Thursday] Generation day - Babies: <\/strong>Cherish this day, because it is by far one of the comfiest days you will experience all year. If you\u2019re feeling stumped on outfit choices, we recommend looking back on all your #tbt pics on Instagram for some inspiration. Our tips: wear a onesie. Don\u2019t limit yourself to the typical, patternless onesies; look around and find unique, flashy or character-oriented onesies. To accompany your outfit, you can wear a saggy diaper with a bonnet. A binky, pacifier or bottle of milk is a nice addition to all baby days as well. Feel free to bring your favorite stuffed animal to school, and please don\u2019t act like you don\u2019t have any more stuffed animals, because we all secretly snuggle with one at night.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Friday] Paly - Green and White: <\/strong>Wear absolutely all the Paly gear that you can find stashed somewhere in your closet. If you can\u2019t seem to find much, look for any green and white clothing located around the house. We want to see green and white hair with green and white faces on the last day of the best week.

Let UNO be your inspiration. If you are planning on wearing a jersey, don\u2019t limit yourself to the most famous and typical soccer players such as Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. Contrary to popular belief, they really weren't the only players who\u00a0participated in the World Cup. If you don\u2019t have a jersey, don\u2019t fret.

Try to grow a beard within the next few days since most working cowboys don\u2019t have time to shave on the ranch. Overalls are a great addition to any ranch outfit as well, and don't forget your bandana. Remember, if you're ever feeling down, just saddle up.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Wednesday] Color day - Red:<\/strong> This is a super easy color to dress up for.\u00a0All you have to do is find any red items you can scavenge around the house. If that\u2019s not enough, head on over to Target or Spirit. You\u00a0can wear red shirts, tights, tutus, boas, sunglasses, socks and more. To top off the look, take your brightest red nail polish and lipstick and apply. Guys, too.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Thursday] Generation day - Teenyboppers: <\/strong>We personally didn\u2019t know much about Teenyboppers last year, so here are a few definitions to help clear up the confusing term. \u201cThe term was introduced in the 1950s to refer to teenagers who mainly listened to pop music and\/or rock and roll and not much else,\u201d according to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Teenybopper\">Wikipedia<\/a>. Teenyboppers are also synonymous to Greasers, a youth subculture that originated in the '50s among teenagers. Take your inspiration from outfits in the popular movie \u201cGrease\u201d or by searching images for \u201cFashion for teenage boys\/girls in the 1950s.\u201d For guys: it is time to apply lots and lots of gel. We recommend buying two bottles just in case you happen to run out. Make sure to reapply during break, lunch, passing periods and class itself - remember, you can never have too much gel. The gel will give you a sleek-haired look that\u2019ll take you straight back to the '50s. For girls: Wear poodle skirts (a few that can be borrowed from Paly\u2019s Theatre Department), red lip stick, \u201cpink lady\u201d jackets and your mother\u2019s pearls that you\u2019ve always been looking for an excuse to wear.\u00a0Don\u2019t forget your leather jacket with boots or Chuck Taylors, which can be bought for $10 at certain thrift stores.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Friday] Paly - Green and White: <\/strong>Wear absolutely all the Paly gear that you can find stashed somewhere in your closet. If you can\u2019t seem to find much, look for any green and white clothing located around the house. We want to see green and white hair with green and white faces on the last day of the best week.

The pirate theme, at least for us, seems to be a relatively hard day to dress up for. If you put yourself in a situation where you've been at sea for many months and you potentially have scurvy, it's alright to assume that you won\u2019t have the most glamorous outfit. Grab a large, flowy, white t-shirt and cut off the ends of the sleeves and the bottom of the shirt in a jagged manner. Paint blue stripes across the front and back of the shirt. For accessories, you can wear a bandana around your neck, a pirate belt, eye patch, one large hoop earring and a plastic sword.

If you want to think outside the box, dress up as a scuba diver with flippers; but make sure that you take the walking backwards approach or we might see a few scratched up faces at the rally. Boys, start working on those abs ASAP (we recommend the local gym). Have no fear of the bright tropical colors and floral patterns that you'll be wearing on this day. For all juniors, grab your dad\u2019s oversized Hawaiian shirt, shorts, hula skirts, coconut bras, leis and flip-flops, and you\u2019re good to go.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Wednesday] Color day - Yellow: <\/strong>If you\u2019re going for the <i>\u201c<\/i>wear whatever I can find that is yellow\" look, we recommend patrolling through your house, finding all yellow items and placing them on your body with yellow tape. See that banana? Ring, ring, bringing the banana phone back.\u00a0See that highlighter? That's your writing utensil for the day.\u00a0On the other hand, there are also character-specific outfits such as banana costumes, minion suits and Spongebob outfits. If you combine the \u201cwear whatever I can find that is yellow\" look with the costume specific outfit, you may find yourself in the running for Best Dressed.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Thursday] Generation day - Sophisticates:<\/strong> Dress for success. Ladies and gentleman, this is the day to impress all your fellow peers by looking like a successful and accomplished lady and gentleman that you will soon become. Pick your favorite role model and be them for the day. Ladies tend to either wear dresses, skirts with fancy blouses or pant suits. Each of these items can be paired with flats or heels, but keep in mind that you may want some practice with running in heels if you plan to get a good spot on the bleachers during the rallies. Gentlemen can bring on the tux and ties, with a briefcase in hand. Don\u2019t forget your cup of coffee in the morning and your handy pocket book dictionary and thesaurus, which we hope you read the night before so that you\u2019ll look astute for Sophisticates day.\r\n\r\n<strong>[Friday] Paly - Green and White:\u00a0<\/strong>Wear absolutely all the Paly gear that you can find stashed somewhere in your closet.

Although we would enjoy seeing a few of you face-plant on the Quad, we will also pity you, so here are our words of advice.

Photo by Jeanette Wong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nHosted by the Parent Teacher Student Association, the event included a powerpoint presentation by Social Justice Pathway teachers Eric Bloom and Erin Angell, as well as a question and answer session following the presentation.\r\n\r\nThe Social Justice Pathway, a three-year program that integrates subject curriculum with community action, made its debut at the beginning of the 2014-15 school year at Paly. It is one of <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/02\/04\/school-board-to-vote-on-new-courses-at-next-meeting\/\">several additions<\/a> to the course catalog this year.\r\n\r\nBloom and Angell expressed the success of the pathway by sharing a story of experiential learning. Angell recalls a student\u2019s request to walk out of class in the middle of a lesson about power and the concept of having power over someone.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought that it was probably the best way that I\u2019ve ever taught,\u201d Angell said. \u201cIt was the first time in Palo Alto where students dared to try something like that. It was invigorating, I thought it was great \u2014 it felt very real, [it was] great for me as a teacher, [and it was] very exciting.\r\n\r\nUnique features of the pathway include internship opportunities, field trips, experiential learning activities and a Capstone Project, in which students \u201cgenerate a sustainable plan, execute and reflect on measurable goals,\u201d according to Angell.\r\n\r\nOne of the goals of the program is to highlight the value students see in their community. Instead of taking advantage of volunteer opportunities for the sake of getting the President\u2019s Service Award, the teachers encourage students to add value to the organization.\r\n\r\n\u201cErin [Angell] and I had a strong sense that we see a difference between the concept of service versus volunteering,\u201d Bloom said. \u201cWhat we want to acknowledge is that service, from our perspective, is you\u2019re adding value to an organization. We\u2019re trying to get kids to understand that they have value, that they can make value in the community.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition, the grading method of the new pathway differs from traditional types.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerformance tasks are graded by completion but are evaluated on a scale from emergent, not really meeting the goals of this task, to mastery, that says you really have,\u201d Bloom said. \u201cThere\u2019s a third category in our grade book, which is reflection.

Sound familiar?\r\n\r\nThe combination of Spirit Week with the already present academic workload can make for an overwhelming experience.\r\n\r\nWhile I recognize the immense time and effort teachers put into creating lesson plans for us, I believe students should have a test-free, stress-free Spirit Week.\r\n\r\nSpirit Week is the one week that the entire student body (or the majority, at least) is involved in a single activity, and many can agree this event generates a sense of pride for both one\u2019s respective class and Palo Alto High School itself. By drawing out the competitiveness in all of us, Spirit Week gets us involved and encourages us to work together towards the common goal of securing bragging rights for being Spirit Week champions. It\u2019s a week for students to have fun and enjoy the high school experience.\r\n\r\nTests, projects, presentations and other major assignments can detach people from the full Spirit Week experience. Instead of being on the bleachers cheering for their class, some students may find themselves stressing over a test or scrambling to put the finishing touches on a project.\r\n\r\nOf course, wishing for a full week of school without any homework at all would be absurd. But in the spirit of Spirit Week, teachers should reserve the three class periods during that week for relatively less rigorous activities. By doing so, teachers will relieve students of the additional stress associated with tests and huge assignments.\r\n\r\nAs Pink Floyd sings, \u201cTeachers, leave them kids alone\u201d (at least during Spirit Week). Allow us to release our energy and scream our hearts out at the pep rallies without the thought of tests nagging at the back of our minds. With only four years at Paly, we should be able to optimize our time here by living it up during Spirit Week.\r\n\r\nSo I respectfully say, teachers, please show your Paly spirit by giving us space during Spirit Week.","excerpt":"Spirit Week generates a sense of pride for both one\u2019s respective class and Palo Alto High School itself.
