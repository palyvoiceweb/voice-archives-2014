Every good Palo Alto native\u2019s done it \u2013 the sauntering walks along shady trees, the grumbling of the stomach, the polite reading of menus at restaurants whose prices belong more in the real estate world than cuisine. University Avenue is a sprawling bazaar of the flavorful and the unique, yet the upscale restaurateurs and the chain giants that beckon you at every seem all too large, all too fancy for a simple bite. The end goal is a place that\u2019s open to sizable families, casually dressed business people and small conglomerations of Stanford and high school students.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_79837\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"400\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/pendiningpic1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-79837\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/pendiningpic1.jpg\" alt=\"pendiningpic Pizzeria Delfina opened in Palo Alto in April 2014 and is considered a favorite by many local residents.

However, the loud ambience overwhelms once the patron outgrows spaghetti that obviously stuck to quantity instead of tastefulness. Where to go if you want a place that\u2019s warm and friendly, quiet yet ambient, with quality food that fills you to target satisfaction? Just step past the crowds of the Buca (which means \u201chole\u201d in Italian, a fitting name for the behemoth chain\u2019s selling power and adornments that seem to lure in many a family) and you\u2019ll find yourself at Pizzeria Delfina, a restaurant that doesn\u2019t pull you in yet makes you stop at its subdued entrance. Many families and students are milling about, waiting for their tables. At Delfina, there may be a wait, but there\u2019s a friendly staff member who will take down your name. And don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s nothing like the large crowds you\u2019ll find on many a sidewalk curb down the downtown stretch. If you do come during their busy hours (mainly dinner), you can admire the restaurant\u2019s low-key layout. The outside facade is a modern twist on Romanesque pillars, two gray solid tiers with sharp fluting. Warm light escapes from the modern lamp fixtures within, and if the evening air is to your liking, Pizzeria Delfina offers an al fresco dinner under a gazebo, lights and growing vines sprouting off the surrounding walls. When inside, the minimalistic yet comfortable atmosphere doesn\u2019t make the restaurant feel special or significant. Instead, it just feels warm and gives that nice middle ground between an evening out and your dining table at home. According to the general manager, a friendly man dressed in the jeans and plaid of almost all the staff, that\u2019s exactly what Pizzeria Delfina was going for. \u201cIt [Pizzeria Delfina] was just a collaboration, our owners and chefs coming together and coming up with a different concept, something a little more casual, something a little more fun.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_79843\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"250\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/10685218_302301439979745_457660940_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-79843\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/10685218_302301439979745_457660940_n.jpg\" alt=\"Chefs cooking in the Pizzeria Delfina kitchen.

According to their website, Delfina aims to bring people together through delicious food. Photo by Tara Madhav.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAt the table, they offer a small plate of spices (a teaspoon of parmesan, oregano and red chili) and a small container of breadsticks as the centerpiece. The breadsticks are not special, but they give something to nibble on. As you snack, take a moment to look up at the rough wooden beams above, a contrast to the white walls and sharp blue tiles on the kitchen wall that works for the impressions of the restaurant. An interesting combination. Another noticeable attraction is the '80s song collection on the restaurant speakers. These aren\u2019t obscure, atmospheric songs. No, these are stratospheric, multi-platinum, head nodding hits like Rick Springfield\u2019s \u201cJessie\u2019s Girl,\u201d Simple Minds\u2019 \u201cDon\u2019t You Forget About Me\u201d and Queen\u2019s \u201cAnother One Bites The Dust.\u201d Even the cooks, who work behind us behind the counter are singing along to these certified crowd pleasers. The casual ambience is neither overwhelming nor insipid, and makes for a very pleasant dining setting. The menu is a reasonable size, with 4 to 6 selections for Antipasti, Today\u2019s Market Specials, Salads, Piatti and Gelato. There is a more extensive list of wine, beer and cocktails for the adults, and their flagship dish of Pizza. The general manager remarks on this menu, part of which changes every day: \u201cAt the core of it all, we do have a core menu. It\u2019s a massive template that we feed off of, so we do a lot of the same things; however, the menu changes on a daily basis and again it speaks to what we were doing on a very, very local basis. \u2026 About 60 percent of our menu is a core menu item\u00a0\u2013 it doesn\u2019t change very often, it doesn\u2019t change at all \u2013 and the other 40 percent has the opportunity to change everyday, so it\u2019s big work.\" Scouring a constantly changing menu for an acceptable variety of food that reflects the restaurant is hard, but eventually we make our selections. Our waiter is a nice, friendly guy who enthusiastically recommends the Bucatini All \u201cAmatricana\u201d pasta ($16). We take him up on his suggestion and order the dish. But first up is Martin\u2019s Farm Spigariello ($5.75). It\u2019s a small dish of broccoli leaves tossed in lemon, chili and garlic. The greens are juicy and oily, and seem to melt on the tongue. The leaves easily come apart and can be easily eaten \u2013 not at all tough or dense like many vegetable greens. Overall, the Spigariello was quite tasty. The waiter brings us the Bucatini pasta soon after, a tasty spin on regular spaghetti. The noodles are al dente yet don\u2019t outweigh the sauce, which is the obvious highlight of the dish. The sauce is laden with rich tomato and an unidentifiable kick that gives the sauce an interesting edge. Adding to the dish are little pieces of pancetta (bacon), which add some texture to the pasta but do not have a very distinct taste. The biggest part of our meal is yet to come, with the two pizzas. The first is the Salsiccia (15.75), topped with fennel sausage, tomato, bell peppers, onions and mozzarella. The pizza is slightly spicy like the other dishes, yet is surprisingly sparse in cheese. The pizza stills holds its own though, and boasts a distinct spice and combination of flavors. The next pizza is the classic Margherita (mozzarella, basil and tomato, $13). The sauce and crust are tasty, but the mozzarella is sparse, with only one medium circle in the middle of the pizza, and the rest just sauce and crust. The basil is also lacking, with only a couple of sparse leaves on any given slice. Still, while I want more of the cheese and basil, the pizza isn\u2019t bad \u2013 just average.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_79847\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"400\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/10841594_302302616646294_446401266_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-79847\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/10841594_302302616646294_446401266_n.jpg\" alt=\"What remains of the Salsiccia pizza following consumption.

Photo by Tara Madhav.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThroughout the meal, almost all of the ingredients are bold and have their own presence in the food, rather than simply being mixed into a given sauce or dough. Each component has a distinct flavor that pairs nicely with the rest of the dish. The general manager enthusiastically remarks on this obvious standout of the meal. \u201cWe totally geek out on the produce that we get,\u201d he exclaims. \u201cWe look at it, we analyze it, these guys come up with, the chefs come up with crazy recipes for it but they really like the ingredients speaking for themselves.\u201d By the time we\u2019re done, my plate is streaked with splotches of orange oil, and there\u2019s a small gathering of sausage and Bucatini sauce entrails on the curve of my plate. While the food came in sizeable portions, there is still a little part of my stomach that can accommodate dessert. Pizzeria Delfina desserts consist of one item: gelato. We order the Coppa ($5), which offers us two flavors in one dish. The first creamy scoop is the Buffalo Milk Stracciatella (stracciatella is a special cheese made in Southern Italy). The name leaves some room for skepticism, but we find it to be delicious. The gelato is streaked with chocolate and melted easily, becoming a milky substance on the tongue. It is the perfect amount of sweet yet thin in consistency, making it as nice and simple a flavor as vanilla ice cream. And there is no taste of the cheese, which is no cause for complaint. The second half consists of Carmel Corn, which packs a heavy punch. From the first taste, the distinctness of the corn and caramel are striking \u2013\u00a0these flavors are not muted like the Stracciatella. It has very nutty overtones \u2013\u00a0to make comparisons, the gelato is like eating only moderately sweet kettle corn. However, the Carmel Corn\u2019s interesting flavor does not lessen its appeal, and it is definitely very tasty. The meal, overall, is about $62 for the three of us. This may seem expensive, but keep into account how much we ordered. Subtract the amount, and it is actually quite reasonable. After the meal, I pack up three leftover pieces of the Salsiccia and add a dollop of the Bucatini sauce onto one of the slices. The dinner setting is casual, yet the food is top notch \u2013\u00a0truly the best of both worlds on a street full of opposing culinary options. It\u2019s a great place for a laid back meal any day of the week for a hungry soul.","excerpt":"Guest writer Tara Madhav shares her review of eating at trendy downtown restaurant Pizzeria Delfina.

Photo by Ana Caklovic.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAre you dreading that test next period? Are you just tired of school? Are you thinking of pulling the fire alarm to escape your necessary duties?\r\n\r\nAlthough it may seem like an easy escape route, it turns out that the risks are high. Pulling the fire alarm in the absence of a fire not only has the potential to put students and faculty in danger, but it also puts the perpetrator in the position of potentially\u00a0being charged with\u00a0a\u00a0misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nLast Tuesday, when the fire alarm sounded at lunch, students made their way to\u00a0Palo Alto High School's football field as they have been conditioned to do for years. Anxious faces looked around for signs of fire or whiffs of smoke, but the safety whistle soon sounded and students were sent back to class.\r\n\r\nIt was yet another student-mediated false alarm, according to Palo Alto High School Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson.\r\n\r\nWhile faking an emergency may seem harmless, here are several reasons that should make you think twice before setting off that gently resting fire alarm on the wall, softly whispering your name to be pulled.\r\n\r\n<strong>1. It is a misdemeanor<\/strong>\r\n\r\n\u201cIt [pulling a false fire alarm] is a citable offense by the police, but\u00a0it's debatable if it's\u00a0a suspendible\u00a0offense,\u201d Berkson said.\r\n\r\nAccording to California Penal Code Section 148.4, any individual who willfully tampers with a fire alarm apparatus or transmits any false sense of a fire is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for a year or less, and or by a fine less than\u00a0$1,000.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if a\u00a0misdemeanor offense doesn't deter you, maybe getting caught will. The sheer number of people and cameras around campus make it easy\u00a0for administrators to find the perpetrator(s), so there is a high risk for pulling it, according to Berkson.\r\n\r\nIf any eye-witness or camera\u00a0around school reports or captures an individual or group of people pulling a fire alarm, the perpetrator(s) will face the consequences, according to Berkson.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. It's dangerous and takes away from actual emergencies<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFalse fire alarms are dangerous to both students inside of school and individuals within the community.\r\n\r\nWhen there are almost 2,000 students on the field, with some under the\u00a0impression that there\u2019s a real emergency, havoc can break loose and people\u00a0can get injured in their stampede to safety. As outlined in the California Penal Code Section 644:3-b, false alarms have the potential to cause injury and even death. Under those circumstances, the perpetrators can be charged with felonies.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, when a fire alarm is pulled, firetrucks are immediately\u00a0notified\u00a0and they begin to head to Paly. If someone is injured at school on their way to the football field, it may be necessary for an\u00a0ambulance and potentially the police to come to the scene as well.\u00a0However, if an even greater emergency is occurring elsewhere, it will take a considerable amount of time for the emergency personnel to arrive to\u00a0the remote location.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are taking away resources if there was a fire [happening elsewhere],\u201d Berkson said.\r\n\r\nFalse alarms also desensitize students and can pose a danger in the event of a real fire.\r\n\r\n\"I feel like people don't take the alarms seriously,\" freshman Vivian Yang said. \"We walk really slowly and its unrealistic.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>3. It wastes time<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAn alarm delays both students and faculty from completing their current tasks. The time it takes to ensure that each student is present, as well as have all members walk from the football field and back\u00a0to class takes a considerable amount of time, according to Berkson.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disruption of class,\u201d Berkson said. \u201cIndividually, there are a lot of tasks that need to be done and they add up.\u00a0It is a whole operation.\u201d\r\n\r\nFire alarms also directly affect the classroom.\r\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\">\"Some class periods are really tightly designed where every minute really counts and there is a lot that needs to get accomplished, so that tends to be more upsetting,\" english teacher Melissa Laptalo said. \"One\u00a0class might have a fire alarm and another class doesn't, and it gets your classes off rhythm from one another.\"\r\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\">Students also find the alarms to be disruptive.\r\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\">\"I feel like it violates the integrity of the classrooms in which we are exploring the nature of education,\" Yang said. \"It takes too long and we sit in the cold or heat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Although it may seem like an easy escape route, pulling the fire alarm without a fire not only has the potential to put students and faculty in danger, but the perpetrator can also be charged with a misdemeanor.","date":"2014-12-04 14:03:12","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/fire.jpg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8520":"Berkson","33670":"false","33695":"false fire alarm","33672":"felony","33669":"fire","10447":"fire alarm","33671":"misdemeanor"}},{"id":79771,"title":"Chicken soup for the teacher&#8217;s soul: A Holiday Gift Guide","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/12\/04\/chicken-soup-for-the-teachers-soul-a-holiday-gift-guide\/","content":"With the holidays fast approaching, some students may be wondering what teachers like to receive as gifts.

Photo by Freddy Kellison-Linn[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAccording to build crew leader Kokontis, one of the main issues is that there are not enough veteran members to teach the new members. Many dangerous saws and drills are used in robotics, and it is necessary that every member is\u00a0taught how to correctly use these tools. Most of these tools are used daily, so every member must be completely capable and experienced, according to Kokontis.\r\n\r\n\"Students will stay on the team based on attendance, participation and if they come to the meetings on Thursdays and weekends,\" Kokontis said.\r\n\r\nDealing with the large number of members was delayed this year because normally students would have already started to drift away from meetings and build days by this time.\r\n\r\nKuszmaul said that the majority of Team 8 is student-run, but this is one moment when he will have to decide who has to go.\r\n\r\n\"If the captain had to make these decisions, it would open him up to complaints from parents,\" Kuszmaul said. \"Precisely for that reason, it has to be my decision.\"\r\n\r\nThe Robotics Team is thrilled to have so many people who want to be a part of it.\r\n\r\n\"It's a happy problem to have,\" Kuszmaul said. \"I'm very proud of my students, and to some extent myself, that students are attracted to [the environment] so much that they don't want to stop coming.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_79689\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_0064-2.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-79689\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_0064-2.jpeg\" alt=\"Students work in the robotics lab.
