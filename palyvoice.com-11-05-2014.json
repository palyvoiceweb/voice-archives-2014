As wave after wave of senioritis sweeps the school it doesn't seem so ridiculous to ditch sixth period to go to the beach or take the train up to the city. After all, you're in college, so there's nothing to worry about, right?\r\n\r\nWell, maybe.\r\n\r\nIf you're like me and falling off the academic bandwagon possibly a little <em>too<\/em>\u00a0hard, check out these super fun tips and tricks to hold your senioritis at bay because, hey, nobody likes being rescinded.\r\n\r\nTIP NUMBER ONE: Study outside. Next time you're headed to the park to work on your tan, grab a textbook on your way out the door. Got a 5th period prep? Head out to the Quad with some homework. Now you can work on that summer glow AND learn about biology. Multi-tasking at its finest.\r\n\r\nTIP NUMBER TWO: Make a calendar for yourself. Sure, maybe you're headed to Santa Cruz Wednesday afternoon, but that's no reason you shouldn't do your Spanish homework on Thursday. If you set aside time to work and time for fun, you'll feel a lot less guilty about slacking off one day if you know you'll have time to write that essay the next.\r\n\r\nTIP NUMBER THREE: Reward yourself for being productive. That may mean a Chipotle run, a fresh batch of chocolate-chip cookies or a new pair of shoes, whatever works for you. Maybe reviewing for a quiz means a scoop of ice cream while finally turning in that eight page paper merits a whole banana split.\r\n\r\nTIP NUMBER FOUR: Find a study buddy. Work is more fun with friends, everyone knows that. Pretty soon you'll be looking at each AB Calc review assignment as an excuse to hang out with that cute boy who sits across the room from you, and who doesn't want that?\r\n\r\nTIP NUMBER FIVE: Everything in moderation. For some people, senioritis is partying six nights a week, while for others symptoms include nine hour long Netflix marathons. Try cutting that in half (three parties a week is nothing to shake a stick at...) and spend all your new free time catching up on those 80 pages of AP English reading.\r\n\r\nSo go ahead, skip 3rd period tomorrow, and the next day and the day after that. But really, with four weeks left of school make sure to drop by Paly at least once or twice before graduation.","excerpt":"Check out these super fun tips and tricks to hold your senioritis at bay because, hey, nobody likes being rescinded.","date":"2014-05-06 22:01:46","author":"Paige Esterly","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_0554.jpg","categories":["Opinion"],"tags":[]},{"id":71416,"title":"Paly student hit by car on route to school","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/06\/paly-student-hit-by-car-on-route-to-school\/","content":"A Palo Alto High School student was hit by a car around 8:15 a.m. on route to campus this morning at the intersection of Churchill Avenue and Castilleja Avenue.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">According to an email sent out after the incident by Dean of Students Craig Tuana to Paly faculty, the student, whose injuries were not serious, was taken to the hospital by her parents as a precaution.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_71458\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"476\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/street.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-71458\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/street.jpg\" alt=\"The intersection of Churchill Avenue and Castilleja Avenue during hours while students are in class.
