Her goal in the fourth quarter against the Los Altos Eagles led the Vikings to a 3-2 victory. This is the team's fourth league win of the season. \u00a0Photo by Nika Woodfill.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 water polo team (9-4, 4-1) defeated the Los Altos High School Eagles (4-6, 2-4)\u00a03-2, after an intense battle at\u00a0home on Thursday.\r\n\r\nThe game's crucial\u00a0\u00a0moment came in the fourth\u00a0quarter when junior Alina Drebin scored a bar-in cross-cage goal from the eight meter mark. The goal tied up the game 2-2 and helped give the Vikings\u00a0the defining push they \u00a0needed to overcome the players' fatigue. This would give them\u00a0the upper hand that would lead to their victory.\r\n\r\nThe game commenced with an almost immediate temporary ejection of Junior Gigi Rojahn, giving Los Altos a six on five advantage. \u00a0Playing a man up, Los Altos scored the first goal of the match coming from an unmarked Eagle\u00a0on the right post.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings came back determined in the second half with the score at 1-0. Rojahn won the sprint to start the third quarter, portraying the team\u2019s new found confidence. Half-way through the third quarter, sophomore Izzy Kelly passed to Rojahn, who shot an unstoppable goal\u00a0into the upper left net from outside the five meter mark, making the score 1-1.\r\n\r\nFrom this point on the game was close. Los Altos\u2019 speedy counterattacks fiercely combated Paly\u2019s determined defense. Both Drebin and Van Hulsen kept Paly defense in check, staying aggressive throughout the game.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe had solid team defense,\u201d Paly head coach Aileen Delaney said. \u201c We showed great teamwork on both ends and really showed our mental toughness.\u201d\r\n\r\nHowever, the team still has room for improvement, according to Rojahn.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe could get a lot more movement on offense and get back quickly on counter attacks.\u201d Rojahn said. \u201cWe also need more confidence to shoot.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is the first time Paly has played Los Altos since losing to the team in the first round of the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League tournament, 8-4.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings are set to play their next game at \u00a0at 6:45 p.m. on Tuesday against Saratoga High School at Saratoga.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto girls' water polo team defeated Los Altos High School 3-2 in a tight game on Thursday.","date":"2014-10-03 00:21:48","author":"Nika Woodfill","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_3019.jpg","categories":["Sports","Sports Recap"],"tags":{"9927":"girls water polo","29696":"Katie Francis","9792":"viking","10248":"wopo"}},{"id":75256,"title":"Associated Student Body releases breast cancer awareness statement","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/02\/associated-student-body-releases-breast-cancer-awareness-statement\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School Associated Student Body released a statement regarding the profits of its Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign that has become controversial among students.\r\n\r\nThe statement can be read by clicking <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1sMlZCzc17CVsPB36jqQGXgwFHHninxmBj3Im4m8iRBg\/edit?pli=1\">here.<\/a>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Associated Student Body released a statement regarding the profits of their Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign that has become controversial among students.","date":"2014-10-02 18:20:09","author":"Lydia Barry","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/IMG_3176.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"8496":"ASB","29491":"breast cancer awareness","8714":"football","8953":"paly","29517":"pink out"}},{"id":75278,"title":"A first look inside Mitchell Park Library","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/02\/a-first-look-inside-mitchell-park-library-2\/","content":"The Mitchell Park Library opened to the community for a sneak peek of the facilities on Saturday.

ASB had sold roughly 175 out of 450 shirts online and in person as of Thursday, according to Student Activities Director Matt\u00a0Hall. Photo by Amy Leung.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAfter a controversy over\u00a0a\u00a0Palo Alto High School Associated Student Body's shirt sale, ASB leaders are reiterating that the focus of the sale is to raise awareness of\u00a0breast cancer.\r\n\r\nAccording to ASB, officers decided to design and sell shirts with a message to raise awareness for breast cancer. The problem was what to do with any profits, although\u00a0Student Activities Director and Japanese teacher Matt Hall said they did not expect any profits.\u00a0Some students read on the <a href=\"http:\/\/paly.net\/event\/buy-asb-pink-out-viking-t-shirts\">Paly website<\/a>\u00a0that the shirts\u2019 profits were not going directly to funding research to cure cancer and took action to express their disapproval through social media.\r\n\r\nOne of these vocal students was junior Griffin Carlson. His <a href=\"http:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/palo-alto-high-school-asb-stop-exploiting-disease-for-revenue-fix-your-mistake#supporters\">petition<\/a> garnered 51 signatures in an hour-and-a-half to protest the sale of the shirts. He closed the petition\u00a0after seeing ASB officers post on Facebook about being open to modifying their plans for the sale, Carlson said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s not morally right to use a disease to gain profit for something else that\u2019s not benefiting people affected by the disease,\u201d Carlson said.\r\n\r\nProceeds could not be directly given to a foundation because <a href=\"http:\/\/www.leginfo.ca.gov\/.const\/.article_16\">California Constitution Article 16 Section Six<\/a>\u00a0states that schools cannot donate to public funds, according to \u00a0Hall. Thus, ASB cannot legally donate to any cancer research foundation.\r\n\r\n\u201cMoney raised by students must be spent on and for students,\u201d Hall said.\r\n\r\nThe situation highlights a challenge many ASB clubs have faced since this law came into effect. The Free the Children Club faced these difficulties when attempting to send money raised by bake sales to its partner village in Ecuador, club member and senior Anna Dukovic said. The club instead had to find alternative methods of giving money to the village.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe used that money to buy bracelets that women had made from many of the different villages and some of this money went to the villages directly, while the other proceeds went to the organization for other uses,\u201d Dukovic said. \u201cWe have also focused more on campaigning and spreading awareness.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis law makes the process of donating money to organizations much more tedious and hindering, Dukovic said, but she said she understands the rationale behind it.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt does prevent our money from blindly being sent to a place without knowing exactly where in the village or organization it will go,\u201d Dukovic said.\r\n\r\nInstead of donating directly to a foundation, ASB will focus on raising awareness by hosting a tailgate for Friday\u2019s football game, Liu said.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen we noticed [donating] was illegal, we still are obviously going to do something about promoting awareness, as well as trying our best to get money to these organizations somehow in a legal way,\u201d Liu said. \u201cOur plan for that is to have charities with their tables at our tailgate.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Alfredo Gonzalez, whose own mother survived breast cancer, feels that there is no use in raising awareness.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of the things that angers me the most is the idea of breast cancer awareness,\u201d Gonzalez said via a comment on Carlson\u2019s petition. \u00a0\u201cEveryone who doesn\u2019t live under a rock knows it exists, so wearing pink doesn\u2019t make you a hero. Donate your money to a legit charity that you care about.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome students, like junior Riley Schoeben, supported the way ASB handled the situation.\r\n\r\n\"I understand how hard it is to raise money for a charitable cause in a way the school allows them to,\" Schoeben said. \"It was a great idea that the t-shirts were used to spread awareness and the proceeds, which appear to be close to nothing, can't be given to an outside organization anyway.\"\r\n\r\nIf there is a profit, which according to Hall is unlikely, \u00a0it will go to the ASB general account. Money in the general account will then be used to subsidize Homecoming and Prom. For example, the general price of tickets will be lowered and subsidized for those who cannot afford tickets.\r\n\r\nCarlson argues that there should not be any profit for ASB if its intention is to spread awareness.\r\n\r\n\u201cASB could have chosen to not make a profit by selling the shirts for a cheaper amount of money, and thus be able to sell more shirts and get that awareness to more students,\u201d Carlson said.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Hall wants to remind students to stay calm about the situation.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s one, take a deep breath,\u201d Hall said. \u201cLet\u2019s support breast cancer awareness by being aware. \u2026 Let\u2019s support Paly. It\u2019s not even about supporting ASB. It\u2019s about, 'Let\u2019s have something fun for Paly on Friday night at the game.' It\u2019s a win-win.\u201d\r\n\r\n<em>Update: ASB has released an <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1sMlZCzc17CVsPB36jqQGXgwFHHninxmBj3Im4m8iRBg\/edit?pli=1\">official statement<\/a> addressing the t-shirt controversy.<\/em>","excerpt":"After a recent debate over social media about where the profits of the ASB's t-shirt sale are going, the Paly Voice decided to get facts from both sides of the argument.

However, that may be subject to change if the situation grows further out of hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s discouraging and disheartening that students treat the MAC this way,\u201d Wixsom said. \u201cI would like to have the MAC as close to the same condition as it was the first day.\u201d","excerpt":"Due to students' failure to throw away trash, food and beverages have been banned from all areas in Palo Alto High School's Media Arts Center this week.","date":"2014-10-01 09:49:53","author":"Christian Leong","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Trash1.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":[]}]
