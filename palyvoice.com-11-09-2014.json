Paulson takes the place of Craig Tuana, who is now an assistant principal at Lynbrook High School.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice: Describe yourself in three words.\r\n\r\nAdam Paulson: I would say I am dedicated, passionate and funny. That\u2019s what would describe me. I have a good sense of humor.\r\n\r\nTPV: What are your first impressions of Paly?\r\n\r\nAP: Well, you know, I think it seems like a really great place to go to high school. Students, the facilities and the grounds \u2013 they\u2019re just tremendous. And from all the students and faculty I\u2019ve already talked to, it just seems like a place that has a lot of pride and school spirit, so I\u2019m excited about that.\r\n\r\nPV: What are you looking forward to this year at Paly?\r\n\r\nAP: I think mostly just trying to find that pulse. I\u2019m very much into school culture and the way students are thinking and feeling, really just trying to talk with as many students and student organizations and athletic organizations as I can so that I can get a pulse for what Paly is about and what the school culture is all about, you know? And try and find ways where I can interject and collaborate with students and teachers.\r\n\r\nPV: If you were a crayon, what color would you be, and why?\r\n\r\nAP: Trying to think back to some of those funky Crayola colors. Maybe a magenta-something that doesn\u2019t \u2014 that has a unique identity \u2013 is it blue? Is it green? I\u2019m a musician myself, too, so I like to express myself, and magenta is I think one of those mysterious colors.\r\n\r\nPV: What instruments do you play?\r\n\r\nAP: Anything with strings, you know,\u00a0guitar, bass.\r\n\r\nPV: Who\u2019s your favorite artist?\r\n\r\nAP: Now that would have to be a whole other interview, right? <em>(laughs).\u00a0<\/em>You know, I play anything from classical to heavy metal. Elvis Costello is one of my favorite musicians, just to name one.\r\n\r\nPV: As \"dean of students,\" what are students likely to see you doing around campus?\r\n\r\nAP: Obviously, as a school administrator, I am going to have the administrative part of that. I\u2019m going to be doing, you know, leading or just being a part of aspects of managing of the school, but you guys don\u2019t want to\u00a0hear about that, right. On the student side of it, you know, you\u2019re the dean, so you really want to interact with students, and it goes back to that, you know, finding the pulse at Paly and just getting to know what student \u2013 what does it mean to you guys, to be a student here, and how can I support and then help those efforts. So, the managerial side of it\u2019s very different than the student-centered part of it. Just try to be visible, you know, talk to you guys a lot, see what\u2019s on your mind.\r\n\r\nPV: If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be and why?\r\n\r\nAP: I\u2019ve always been fascinated with Easter Island, if you\u2019ve ever heard of that place. It\u2019s off of the coast of Peru. I don\u2019t know about living there though, that might be tough. That\u2019s a place I\u2019ve always been fascinated with and would want to check out, so maybe I\u2019d go with that.\u00a0 I\u2019d just hang out on Easter Island and be reflective, then I\u2019d come back to Palo Alto, right.\u00a0<em>(laughs).<\/em>\r\n\r\nPV: What would students be surprised to find in your refrigerator right now?\r\n\r\nAP: That\u2019s actually a really good question. I would say a homemade chicken broth, how\u2019s that sound? I\u2019m quite a cook and a chef, and I like to make stocks and broths, so that might be something that isn\u2019t a normal, everyday item.\r\n\r\nPV: What is something that has surprised you about Paly so far?\r\n\r\nAP: I think one thing that has surprised me a lot is the history actually that a lot of people have. A lot of teachers I\u2019ve talked to and parents during Back to School Night talk about when they went to Paly, especially the teachers, you know,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been here for 20 years!\u201d or \u201c30 years\u201d and \u201cI was a student here at Paly, too!\u201d Usually you might have a couple teachers, but it seems like a lot of the teachers I\u2019ve talked to have a past, which matters on how the school culture is built here.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with new Dean of Students Adam Paulson to learn how his time at Palo Alto High School is going so far.

However, the construction was delayed, which benefits the team, according to\u00a0Head Coach Brandon Johnson.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s an huge advantage [to still have the pool],\" Johnson said. \"It would have been quite difficult to drive to different pools every day to practice.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe water polo players share Johnson's sentiments about having a home pool this year.\r\n\r\n\u201cHaving the pool this season is massive for the team,\u201d junior driver Ryan Reed said. \u201cWe all thought that it would be unavailable, and the thought of having to practice away from home brought a negative feeling to many of my teammates.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe team will need to adapt after graduating 14 seniors last year. However, the Vikings are not expecting those departures to have a huge effect on their level of play.\r\n\r\n\u201cThough losing 14 is tough, this year's squad has the potential to exceed what was accomplished last year,\u201dsenior captain Lukas Novak said. \u201cThe biggest challenge will be seeing if the team can build the same chemistry it did last year.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Novak, Paly is not the only team that lost key players.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery team besides Gunn [High School] will be weaker than it was in the previous year,\u201d Novak said.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of the Paly team, according to both Reed and Novak, is the bench depth. Only seven remaining players were on full varsity last season.\r\n\r\nEven after losing so many players, the Vikings still have high goals for the upcoming season.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur goal is to make CCS like we did last year,\u201d Johnson said.\r\n\r\nHowever,\u00a0Novak says the team's ability to succeed will depend on its ability to play together, making the level of success hard to predict.\r\n\r\nThe team's first game will be held against Monta Vista High School at 6:45 p.m. on Sept. 18 at home.","excerpt":"After making it to the Central Coast Section semi-finals last year, the Palo Alto High School boys' water polo team (24-6, 10-2) is hoping to have another successful season.","date":"2014-09-09 13:08:23","author":"Samuel Desr\u00e9","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/10686502_936996839650447_793134399_o.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"9845":"boys water polo","27720":"brandon johnson","27719":"lucas novak","12045":"season preview","10248":"wopo"}},{"id":73469,"title":"Preview: Apple of my i(Phone 6)","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/08\/preview-apple-of-my-iphone-6\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_73513\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/photo-12.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-73513\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/photo-12.jpg\" alt=\"The iPhone family might soon have a new member.

Diorio addressed the improved learning spaces, new teacher leadership positions and smaller class sizes.\r\n\r\nThe MAC and History\/Math building are two of several improvements to the Paly campus. The new additions received positive feedback from the public, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\nAccording to Diorio, the demolition of the gyms has been delayed due to budget issues. If the final price comes in at budget or below, the renovation process is set to start around Dec. 15. The library is also set to be renovated some time in the future.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the new features of the campus, there are new staff positions designed to help better the school community.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created some additional teacher leadership positions on campus called TOSAs \u2013 Teacher on Special Assignment,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cSome of our teacher leaders are focused on incorporating technology in the classrooms, helping and supporting teachers so that the lessons are more engaging.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother beneficial aspect is the smaller class sizes. Most freshmen and sophomore English courses have 19 to 20 students in each class, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe really wanted to lower those class size ratios so that our teachers are able to have more opportunities to personalize the learning for students and give them feedback in a more timely fashion,\u201d Diorio said.\r\n\r\nIn order to further enhance students\u2019 learning experiences, some of the classrooms have new furnishings.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen teachers are teaching \u2013 even if it\u2019s direct instruction \u2013 a lot of times, we find that [students] are moving maybe in the [new swivel] chairs, but their eyes are still focused on the teacher,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cSo just being able to move their body a little bit and that sensory motor integration is really important in terms of keeping them focused.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition to the presentation, Diorio held a Q&amp;A session for the parents. The PTSA also approved the new budget and bylaw changes at the meeting.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School Principal Kim Diorio is welcoming the 2014-15 school year with optimism and candor, according to comments she made at the first Parent Teacher Student Association General Association Meeting of the school year last night at Paly\u2019s Media Arts Center.

In previous years, students wishing to participate in the dance would audition, and from that group, five guys and five girls were chosen. This year, anyone will be allowed to sign up for their grade's dance, and the minimum number of participants will be five guys and five girls. However, there is no specified maximum, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1AK7YSINyJVLwji-zyfTxk47aUUyb8oM7JCIs6-oT90w\/edit?pli=1\">ASB's meeting minutes<\/a>, which are
