Everyday students will be asked to wear appropriate, comfortable clothing and be on time, according to Director Kathleen Woods.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe auditions are open and then the director, Kathleen Woods, in consultation with musical director, Michael Najar, conducts callbacks, where they see how well an auditioner fits a specific role,\u201d Nguyen said.\r\n\r\nTuesday is dedicated to vocal auditions. Any student who auditions for the musical must audition with 16 bars of a traditional musical theater song. Music Director Michael Najar is available to help students\u00a0choose and rehearse songs. There will be an accompanist available.\r\n\r\nWednesday will be a dance audition day. Students who have tap dance shoes are asked to bring them, according to Kathleen Woods. Additionally, stage movement specialist Kim Saunders will help with the auditions.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe [Saunders] will probably teach a combination and then we [auditioners] will do them in small groups,\u201d senior Jamie Garcia said.\r\n\r\nThursday will be focused on acting. There will be a variety of parts for auditioners\u00a0to read from, and people may be asked to read more than once.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey [students] will be given a 'side,' also known as a scene, to read as their audition,\" junior Clara Baker said. \"They will have time to practice before going up. When it is time for their audition, they should hand their forms to the auditioners and then walk onto the stage, state their name and the character they are reading for, take a moment and then begin. Don't forget to say thank you at the end.\"\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the callback list will be posted <a href=\"http:\/\/www.palytheatre.com\">online<\/a> and on the Haymarket\u00a0doors. Even if students are not called back, there is a high likelihood that they can still be cast in the show. The official list will be posted on Sunday, Nov. 23.\r\n\r\nThere are 12 major parts, and Woods hopes to have an ensemble of 20 to 40 students. The official rehearsal schedule has not yet been released but can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.palytheatre.com\/calendar\/\">here<\/a>. The shows will be held on March 6-8 and 12-14.\r\n\r\nWoods is very excited to hold auditions and see the play come together.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe show is just so fun and everyone can participate,\u201d Woods said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The spring musical, The Drowsy Chaperone, will hold auditions November 18-21.

There are weekly tastings of tea flavors and additions to make the store seem more communal. The syrups and almond jelly are made from scratch, and almost everything is organic, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bobaguys.com\" target=\"_blank\">Boba Guys\u00a0website<\/a>.\r\n\r\nI ordered a drink with almond milk because Boba Guys is one of the few places I\u2019ve been to that has a dairy free option, and I wanted to take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nThe server was generous with the pearls, which were very chewy and flavorful and did not disintegrate. The tea flavor was very strong, but the drink was incredibly sweet. At certain points, some sips would be almost unbearably sweet if the syrup wasn\u2019t completely mixed in.\r\n\r\nA downfall was the slow service, but Boba Guys does call the drinks the \"Slow Bar\" in warning. Also, the drink was served with a snap-on\u00a0lid. Some people may not understand the importance of this, but without a vacuum sealed lid, it is impossible to shake the drink into a perfect mixture with no too-sweet spots.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Boba Delight<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<address style=\"font-weight: inherit;\"><span style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;\">528 Larkin St.,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;\">San Francisco<\/span>,\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;\">94102<\/span><\/address>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_76781\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9884.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-76781 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9884.jpg\" alt=\"Boba Delight was very sweet and watery.

It\u2019s relatively new, and you can purchase glass bottles to bring in again for a discount. Boba Delight also has a stamping rewards system that gives you a free drink after you buy 10 drinks.\r\n\r\nI personally will\u00a0not return and do not recommend that anyone try it. The service was very slow, and once I finally received my drink, I was less than impressed.\r\n\r\nThe drink was incredibly sweet and super syrupy. At the time time, it seemed like they used water instead of milk because it was so thin and not at all creamy. I could not mix the drink to see if it was just mixed poorly because it had a snap-on\u00a0lid.\r\n\r\nThe pearls were very soft and would often clog up the straw.

This location was no exception.\r\n\r\nIt has very fast service, large cup sizes and many options for mix-ins. I chose the usual tapioca pearls which were large and very chewy. The pearls did not leave remnants in the cup, but coated the inner straw and mouth. In general, the drink was sweet, very milky and not very flavorful.\r\n\r\nThe straws were not wrapped, which I have never seen before and made me a little suspicious. Quickly uses the FIVESTARS reward card system and is cash only. I would say that if you can find a flavor you like, go because it\u2019s cheap, but be aware that it\u2019s not very good either.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Plentea<\/strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_76782\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9927.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-76782 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_9927.jpg\" alt=\"Plentea did not have many flavor options but what it did have was delicious.

The food menu is mainly fancy variations on waffles and sandwiches.\r\n\r\nThe staff members were very informative and answered all my questions \u2013 when I went back the next day, they remembered me and were very glad I was back. All drinks are served in cool glass containers, and the store will give you a 10 percent discount if brought back. The bottles also have a lid for transportation and reusability.\r\n\r\nThere was a line out the door that\u00a0was very slow moving, but once you\u2019ve ordered, the drinks come quickly. There are few flavor options, but there are fruit drinks, smoothies, teas and many combinations of all of these.\r\n\r\nThe tea was very flavorful with large, soft pearls. The drink was very creamy and because there was no flavoring, there was no mixing required for a perfectly smooth drink. The texture was even throughout the bottle, which I very much appreciated.\r\n\r\n<i>Please leave a comment to suggest Pearl Milk Tea places you would like reviewed.\u00a0<\/i>","excerpt":"Staff writer Alex Merkle-Raymond takes the PMT challenge to San Francisco where she experiences the best and worst PMT she's ever had.

In a competition for the second open seat and with the provisional ballots uncounted, Crystal-Foster trailed 199 votes behind Godfrey at last count, and the \"uncounted ballots are unlikely to change the outcome,\" Crystal-Foster said in an email to her campaign staff and supporters.\r\n\r\nHere is the full text of her email announcement:\r\n\r\n\"We've all been watching the living lesson that every vote truly counts in our democracy. At this point, the county has recorded all remaining vote-by-mail ballots, and there are only a few thousand uncounted provisional ballots remaining county-wide. Ken Dauber has secured one school board seat, and Terry Godfrey is ahead of me by 199 votes for the second seat. The uncounted ballots are unlikely to change the outcome, so I offer my sincere congratulations to Ken and Terry as the new members of our school board. Both Terry and Ken will be staunch advocates for our students, and I wish them both the best. I have great regard for the talent and dedication that all the candidates brought to this race. My best to Gina Dalma and Jay Cabrera, as well, who share a commitment to education and will, I'm confident, continue their good work on behalf of students. I look forward to continuing my service to the schools and our students, and will do so in a spirit of collaboration with all our school leaders.\r\n\r\n\"I am grateful for the opportunity to have spent these past six months discussing the future of Palo Alto\u2019s schools with so many in our community. I continue to be energized by you, by the opportunities before us, and by the ambition of our new superintendent. To those of you who walked, called, endorsed, created, gave, wrote, informed, and inspired over this campaign -- many, many thanks. We created a network of positive thinkers who care about education that will continue long after the final ballots are counted.\r\n\r\n\"I am privileged to have been surrounded and supported by so many wonderful friends and neighbors in this journey. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.\"\r\n\r\nAn announcement on Crystal-Foster's Facebook page reads:\r\n\r\n\"The last vote-by-mail ballots have been counted, and Ken has retained the first school board seat and Terry is ahead of me by 199 votes for the second. While provisional ballots remain uncounted, it is unlikely that those will change the outcome. Thus, I've reached out to Ken and Terry to congratulate them as our new school board members. They both care deeply about students and I wish them the\u00a0very best. To each and every one of you, I offer my deepest thanks for all your hard work, belief in our positive and forward-looking message, and for your friendship and support. I feel privileged to have worked with such a wonderful team and look forward to continuing to work with you in our schools and community for the benefit of all our students.\"","excerpt":"The contest for the remaining seat on the Palo Alto school board came to an end this morning when Catherine Crystal-Foster announced today that she is pulling out of the race.","date":"2014-11-13 11:28:08","author":"Adele Bloch","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/rsz_img_7834.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"12701":"2014","32676":"catherine crystal-foster","32598":"crystal-foster","29789":"dauber","8667":"elections","29787":"godfrey","8828":"ken dauber","32677":"palo alto school board","9069":"School Board","32674":"terry godfrey","32675":"votes","9219":"voting"}}]
