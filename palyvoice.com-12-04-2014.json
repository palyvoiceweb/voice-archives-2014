So it is not surprising that following the release of a Palo Alto High School senior\u2019s mugshot on several social media sites during the last days of spring break, the Paly community, along with the larger Palo Alto community, became captivated with searching for a better understanding of the situation.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unfortunately, this search has led the community to gossip and make unfounded assumptions about the arrested student and his actions. This tendency has an even greater effect as the discussions are taking place not only on the Quad or between friends, but also in heated discussions online.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The comment sections of websites, such as Facebook in particular, are especially vile as members of the community get heated in their discussions. For example, the mugshot of the student arrested, which the Palo Alto Police Department\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo.php?fbid=664812860221181&amp;set=a.349604361742034.72544.288613124507825&amp;type=1&amp;stream_ref=10\">posted<\/a> on its Facebook page, contains racist and threatening comments and plenty of gossip and speculation. This kind of activity sparks rumors and spreads falsities that can negatively affect this student\u2019s reputation. The student already will face repercussions for his actions, so there is no need to further antagonize the situation.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to social media blasts, there is then the aspect of the face-to-face gossiping that occurs on Paly campus. Over the past week, Paly students have been telling a variety of different versions of the story, which twists the details of the actual occurrences and subsequently leads others to jump to false conclusions. By spreading these falsities the student body unnecessarily adds on to the problems of the student.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While I do not necessarily support the actions of the student, this treatment of the student is simply unacceptable. By resorting to such low methods as gossiping, spreading rumors and racist or threatening remarks, the community is portraying itself in a poor moral-light.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A more appropriate response would have included a way for the student to deal with the repercussions more privately without the community members sticking their noses into and judging the situation. In time, the true events of the situation will become apparent, so spreading false information in the mean time is just pointless. I believe that the Paly community can act much better than we are doing so now. We often pride ourselves on being a progressive and supportive high school and this is our opportunity to prove that we really do fulfill that description.<\/p>","excerpt":"Following the arrest of a Palo Alto high school senior over spring break, the Paly campus leaped into heated discussion.

Following the Silicon Valley Regional, the team is happy to have improved its ranking, according to senior co-captain Freddy Kellison-Linn.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cGenerally the top 24 is where you want to be,\u201d Kellison-Linn said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get picked for elimination rounds but given how we performed at the previous competition everyone was very happy with how we did and it was a good end to the season.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sophomore Claire Kokontis said the team came across a few obstacles, including a part of the robot that was scratching the ball, the object that the robot was meant to shoot into baskets, throughout the competition.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, it faced fewer problems than it did the last tournament, according to Kokontis.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cFor a couple of members it was less stressful for us because there was less to fix so we got more time to just hang out with each other,\u201d Kokontis said.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Kellison-Linn mirrors Kokontis\u2019 sentiments, stating that the Silicon Valley Regional ran significantly smoother than the Central Valley Regional tournament for the team.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWe had an issue in Madera where we couldn\u2019t get the shooter working until the very end, but for this competition we had our shooting working and we did significantly better than we did in Madera,\u201d Kellison-Linn said.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Paly robotics team is proud that its robot is built almost entirely by students, without much mentor help, according to Kokontis.<\/p>\r\n\u201cIt was really surprising for people at the competition to see this robot that had been mainly built by students,\u201d Kokontis said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that makes Paly robotics unique and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re proud of.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is the final tournament for the Paly robotics team during this school year, but the team has much in store for the future including a summer camp program, teaching robotics to younger children and getting ready for the Cal Games tournament during the fall.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School robotics team ranked 22nd out of 58 teams at the Silicon Valley Regional over Spring Break in its final competition of the school year and is now preparing for next year's program.","date":"2014-04-10 13:08:30","author":"Addie McNamara","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/robot.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":[]},{"id":70352,"title":"Preview: Boys\u2019 lacrosse to face off against Sacred Heart","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/08\/preview-boys-lacrosse-to-face-off-against-sacred-heart\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 lacrosse team (6-3, 3-1) will play the Sacred Heart Preparatory team (7-3, 5-0), the first-place seed in the De Anza League, at 4 p.m. today at Sacred Heart.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Vikings lost to the Gators earlier this season, and were knocked out of the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League playoffs in the semi-finals by the Gators last year.\r\n\r\nSenior midfielder Zach Rizk, however, expects Paly to play well at the upcoming game.\r\n\r\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019ve lost to Sacred Heart six times in a row now,\u201d Rizk said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to break that streak today.
