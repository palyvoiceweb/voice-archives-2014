We need to develop more of a determined and competitive side\u00a0\u2013 intensive practices with [fewer]\u00a0distractions.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Harader, in order to achieve the goal of winning the league, Lee and sophomore Avanika Narayan will lead the team along with a couple of strong freshmen.\r\n\r\nOverall, the team has high hopes for the upcoming season in terms of enjoyment and success.\r\n\r\n\"I hope that our team is ready to compete and they\u2019re excited and just go into it and play their hearts out,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThat\u2019s all you can ask.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girls' tennis team will play against Woodside at 4 p.m. tomorrow at home.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School girls' tennis team prepares for a new season, making adjustments with the loss of key players and dropping down a league.","date":"2014-09-02 22:59:09","author":"Amy Leung","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/tennispreview.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"25273":"andy harader","10019":"girls tennis","25271":"madeline lee","25272":"narayan","25274":"paly tennis","10016":"tennis","25275":"woodside"}},{"id":73282,"title":"Club forms due at 3:30 p.m. on Sept. 5 in the SAO","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/02\/club-forms-due-at-330-p-m-on-sept-5-in-the-sao\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2014-09-02 21:00:29","author":"Lizzie Chun","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":{"25411":"club forms","8636":"deadline"}},{"id":73284,"title":"Senior panoramic during Advisory on Sept. 18 on the football field","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/02\/senior-panoramic-during-advisory-on-sept-18-on-the-football-field\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2014-09-02 20:59:53","author":"Lizzie Chun","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":{"25412":"panoramic","8985":"photo","9085":"senior"}},{"id":73124,"title":"Robotics Team expanding to include Art Team","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/09\/02\/robotics-team-expanding-to-include-art-team\/","content":"Palo Alto High School\u2019s Robotics Team plans to expand to include an art team with subdivisions of animation, graphic design, sketching and storytelling, according to\u00a0graphic design teacher\u00a0Brett Griffith, who will supervise the new group.\r\n\r\nAnimation Captain senior Griffin Bajor is creating the\u00a0team\u00a0to bring a creative opportunity to students across campus.
