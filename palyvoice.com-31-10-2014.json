At\u00a0the second station, players sucked\u00a0through a toilet paper roll to pick up two different ornaments, which were to be placed on a string.

The Wildcats outscored the Vikings 42-0 in the final three quarters, as the Vikings defense surrendered 256 rushing yards and five touchdowns on the ground. This week, head coach Jake Halas emphasized moving on from last week's disaster and focusing on the pass-heavy offense of Santa Clara.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_77412\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/10722247_771709889553738_1626690407_o1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-77412\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/10722247_771709889553738_1626690407_o1.jpg\" alt=\"Junior receiver Oliver Svirsky cradles in a pass during the Vikings 20-19 loss against Wilcox.

Photo by Josh Yuen.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\"To win a football game, you have to be able to stop the run and run the ball,\" Halas said. \"Obviously, we had a heck of a time shutting down Los Gatos' running game. Having said that, we're playing a team that throws the ball 75 percent of the time, so even though they do have a running game, they throw the ball a lot. That's what we're focusing on more. But if they want to run the ball, we have to stop it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bruins, still winless against league opponents, are coming off of a break-out 54-14 victory over the Lynbrook Vikings (0-7, 0-3) from the El Camino League. Despite a disappointing performance last week, junior wide receiver and captain Eli Givens said that the Vikings' mindset has not wavered from its winning attitude.\r\n\r\n\"We're just going to continue onto this week's game and forget about last week's,\" Givens said. \"Our mindset is to just win this week. Again, finish plays and make every play count and win.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked about potential rainy weather forecasted for Friday evening, Halas said that his team is eager to build off of previous success that they have had in bad weather.\r\n\r\n\"We've had great success in bad weather games since I've been here,\" Halas said. \"I like it. The kids like it. We're looking forward to it.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the contest will have a more ceremonial vibe to it due to homecoming activities, Givens accentuated that the team is treating it just like any other game.\r\n\r\n\"It's just another game to play,\" Givens said. \"It's another chance to get the W [win].\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings and Bruins kick off at 7 p.m. this Friday, Oct. 31 at Hod Ray Field. All fans are encouraged to wear as much black as they can to display their Paly spirit, according to senior Livi Clarissa Musil.

The menu provides the customer with a variety of options. For example, both the ice and sweetness levels can be adjusted from the standard to be at 30 percent or 80 percent.\r\n\r\nI personally got the standard amounts and found it a little sweet. The pearls are fairly large and very soft. The drink itself is not very thick and creamy, but the tea flavor is not overpowering.\r\n\r\nThe current Palo Alto location is very clean and has a blue color theme around the entire restaurant. There is room for seating, and it is easy to see into the back work area where the drinks are made.\r\n\r\nThe staff is very friendly and can answer any questions. Manager Miki Murphy was excited to mention that all tea is brewed on site and changed out every hour, even if it not used up completely.\r\n\r\nT4 is currently scheduled to be open from 11 a.m. to 11\u00a0p.m.\u00a0and currently does not have a significant line.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s delicious.

Photo by Phoebe So.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPalo Alto High School students are gearing up to dress inn their respective classes' color for \"Color Day\" on\u00a0Day Three of Spirit Week tomorrow.\r\n\r\nEach class will wear\u00a0their respective colors: seniors will wear green, juniors will wear yellow, sophomores will wear red and freshmen will wear orange.\r\n\r\nTomorrow's activities include two rallies: one during brunch and one during lunch. The brunch rally features a hula hoop game, which involves passing a hoop in between people holding hands in a line as fast as possible. The first team to get the hoop across the line and back wins and earns 200 points. The lunch rally will feature a relay race, involving five separate stations tasks. Whichever grade finishes first wins will gain\u00a0400 points.\r\n\r\nSenior Hannah Nguyen has enjoyed Spirit Week so far and is excited for\u00a0the next few days.\r\n\r\n\"I think seniors have the best themes,\" Nguyen said. \"I've had a lot fun dressing up in '90s gear and togas, and I'm really looking forward to Color Day.\"\r\n\r\nNguyen also has high hopes for the senior class despite the juniors' lead after the first two day's events.\r\n\r\n\"I think that our spirit could be stronger,\" Nguyen said. \"If we stay focused and energetic, we can definitely pull ahead.\r\n\r\nSophomore Andrea O'Riordan is also looking forward to Color Day.\r\n\r\n\"I'm really excited for all of the activities, especially the relay,\" O'Riordan said. \"I'm excited for all of Spirit Week. I think every activity is really fun to watch and participate in.\"\r\n\r\nO'Riordan is proud of her class so far.\r\n\r\n\"We've really improved,\" O'Riordan said. \"We're really spirited this week, and we're ready to come out and do well. We've come a long way.\"","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School students will dress by color for \"Color Day\" on Day Three of Spirit Week tomorrow.","date":"2014-10-28 22:45:44","author":"Ido Gal","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/IMG_5219.jpg","categories":["Spirit Week 2014"],"tags":{"12701":"2014","9717":"color day","9852":"rally","9119":"Spirit Week"}}]
