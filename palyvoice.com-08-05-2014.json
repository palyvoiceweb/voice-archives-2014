As wave after wave of senioritis sweeps the school it doesn't seem so ridiculous to ditch sixth period to go to the beach or take the train up to the city. After all, you're in college, so there's nothing to worry about, right?\r\n\r\nWell, maybe.\r\n\r\nIf you're like me and falling off the academic bandwagon possibly a little <em>too<\/em>\u00a0hard, check out these super fun tips and tricks to hold your senioritis at bay because, hey, nobody likes being rescinded.\r\n\r\nTIP NUMBER ONE: Study outside. Next time you're headed to the park to work on your tan, grab a textbook on your way out the door. Got a 5th period prep? Head out to the Quad with some homework. Now you can work on that summer glow AND learn about biology. Multi-tasking at its finest.\r\n\r\nTIP NUMBER TWO: Make a calendar for yourself. Sure, maybe you're headed to Santa Cruz Wednesday afternoon, but that's no reason you shouldn't do your Spanish homework on Thursday. If you set aside time to work and time for fun, you'll feel a lot less guilty about slacking off one day if you know you'll have time to write that essay the next.\r\n\r\nTIP NUMBER THREE: Reward yourself for being productive. That may mean a Chipotle run, a fresh batch of chocolate-chip cookies or a new pair of shoes, whatever works for you. Maybe reviewing for a quiz means a scoop of ice cream while finally turning in that eight page paper merits a whole banana split.\r\n\r\nTIP NUMBER FOUR: Find a study buddy. Work is more fun with friends, everyone knows that. Pretty soon you'll be looking at each AB Calc review assignment as an excuse to hang out with that cute boy who sits across the room from you, and who doesn't want that?\r\n\r\nTIP NUMBER FIVE: Everything in moderation. For some people, senioritis is partying six nights a week, while for others symptoms include nine hour long Netflix marathons. Try cutting that in half (three parties a week is nothing to shake a stick at...) and spend all your new free time catching up on those 80 pages of AP English reading.\r\n\r\nSo go ahead, skip 3rd period tomorrow, and the next day and the day after that. But really, with four weeks left of school make sure to drop by Paly at least once or twice before graduation.","excerpt":"Check out these super fun tips and tricks to hold your senioritis at bay because, hey, nobody likes being rescinded.","date":"2014-05-06 22:01:46","author":"Paige Esterly","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/IMG_0554.jpg","categories":["Opinion"],"tags":[]},{"id":71416,"title":"Paly student hit by car on route to school","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/06\/paly-student-hit-by-car-on-route-to-school\/","content":"A Palo Alto High School student was hit by a car around 8:15 a.m. on route to campus this morning at the intersection of Churchill Avenue and Castilleja Avenue.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">According to an email sent out after the incident by Dean of Students Craig Tuana to Paly faculty, the student, whose injuries were not serious, was taken to the hospital by her parents as a precaution.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_71458\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"476\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/street.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-71458\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/street.jpg\" alt=\"The intersection of Churchill Avenue and Castilleja Avenue during hours while students are in class.

Photo by Callie Walker.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWith Advanced Placement tests are right around the corner, many Palo Alto High School juniors are likely wondering how they should prepare for their first round of AP testing. Having taken AP tests last year, the Voice's own Jared Schwartz and Becca Raffel offer their two cents on advice to prepare, and several other seniors as well as AP U.S. History teacher Jack Bungarden join the conversation.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, many people greatly overestimate the need to frantically prepare for these examinations, and\u00a0they forget one crucial element: they\u00a0have been preparing for the exam all year.\r\n\r\nWhy did you read every chapter of <em>American Pageant<\/em>? And learn how to use a voice recorder in Spanish? And diligently participate in all the biology labs?\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is, AP tests are made to reflect\u00a0what you have learned all year, not how much content you can cover in the next few days. Staying focused all year is crucial to success on the tests, according to senior Sarah Ohlson.\r\n\r\n\"Your teachers prepared you well throughout the year and as long as you stayed focused first semester you will do well second semester,\" Ohlson said.\r\n\r\nDon't get us wrong \u2013 a little spot review on areas that you might have forgotten is a great plan, but there is no need to go overboard with it. AP U.S. History teacher Jack Bungarden addresses the importance of reviewing.\r\n\r\n\"Study,\" Bungarden said. \"Go to review sessions, review your notes, go back and look at class materials, review the stuff you learned back in first semester. \u00a0Take some practice exams.\"\r\n\r\nPurchasing an AP practice booklet can also be beneficial, according to senior Jack Shapiro.\r\n\r\n\"It's really important to buy an AP test prep book if you can,\" Shapiro said. \"They have lots of tips on what problems you'll find and face and what you should review. \u00a0It's definitely worth it to get one to at least practice.\"\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of AP testing that is overlooked is the huge curve on the test. Depending on what AP class you're in, chances are that you have been taking simulated AP tests all year and have been receiving your raw grades on them. On the AP test, that C you have could\u00a0turn into a 5.\r\n\r\n<em>Three suggested\u00a0steps to dominating the test:<\/em>\r\n\r\n1. Pick out the topics that you have struggled with or haven't seen in a while. Make flashcards or have a friend explain them to you.\r\n\r\n2. Briefly skim over all the other material to remind yourself how much you know.\r\n\r\n3. Relax, get a good night's sleep and enter the test with confidence! \"Always choose sleep over study,\" senior Anthony Lim said.\r\n\r\nAll in all, we would like to stress the importance of not stressing about the tests. Sure, do some review and make sure you know your stuff, but\u00a0getting worked up about the tests is neither necessary nor beneficial.\r\n\r\n\"Take it easy and relax about it, it's not a big deal,\" senior Jonathan Mackris said. \"Paly prepares you well for the AP's.\"","excerpt":"With Advanced Placement tests are right around the corner, many Palo Alto High School juniors are likely wondering how they should prepare for their first <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/04\/how-to-prepare-for-ap-testing\/#more-'\" class=\"more-link\">more &raquo;<\/a>","date":"2014-05-04 21:21:50","author":"Becca Raffel","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/Screen-shot-2014-04-29-at-1.07.21-PM.png","categories":["Opinion"],"tags":[]},{"id":71319,"title":"One Acts showcase humor, drama, talent of Theater program","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/02\/one-acts-showcase-humor-drama-talent-of-theater-program\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_71329\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/photo.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-71329\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/photo.jpg\" alt=\"The Theater program's One Acts this year include three original scripts written by Paly students, two adapted scripts, and an improvisational performance.

There are two more shows on Friday May 2 and Saturday May 3. Tickets are $5. Photo by Gavin Libbey[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe annual Palo Alto High School Theater class's One Acts plays allow the program to showcase its students' skills in acting, writing and directing for the stage. After a successful first show, this year's series of short performances have proven once again to be a fun and amusing with a\u00a0diverse lineup.\r\n\r\nThe One Acts showcase is\u00a0the Theater program's last show of the school year and consists of several short plays acted, directed and, in some cases, written by Paly Theater students. Compared to the bigger productions put on earlier in the year, the One Acts performances are quaint and simple, but that is what gives them their charm. Besides, those descriptions probably don't do justice to all the time and work spent on the plays, which makes them even more impressive.\r\n\r\nThis year's lineup includes three original plays written by Paly students, two adapted scripts and a performance by the Paly Improv Troupe.\r\n\r\nThe Improv Troupe, led by senior Marcus Edholm, starts the night off with two rounds of \"foursquare.\" The improv game has four performers organize themselves in a square and rotate at the order of an outside leader. The duo facing the audience starts a scene with each other, but when the leader orders them to rotate, the scene is paused and the new duo starts a different scenario. All the scenes must include a key word given by the audience and must persist between similar duos.\r\n\r\nThe four rapidly-changing stories can get wild and bizarre, but make for some great spontaneous laughs. As with all improv acts there were hits and misses, but the actors stuck to their scenes and characters regardless of whatever strange tangent their partner sent them on, and I enjoyed watching their impromptu stories develop on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe first written performance is \"Tell Me a Story,\" written by senior Curtis Wu and directed by Edholm. In it, sophomore Paul Bleich's stressed and caffeine-addicted character Chris calls upon his cooler, smarter friend Jake, played by sophomore Ophir Sneh, to help him with\u00a0his Psychology course thesis by having him tell Chris three stories to psychoanalyze\u00a0despite not\u00a0having three real cases\u00a0to study.\r\n\r\nHowever, whenever Jake begins a story, the focus shifts to a different scene about a man named Mark, played by junior Guive Assadi, actually being psychoanalyzed by his psychologist Joan, played by sophomore\u00a0Adele Bloch. Mark then tells the story, and the play once again shifts to Sneh acting as the characters Assadi describes. The result is interestingly meta and works as a fantastic way to study characters and personas. My only complaint is that it ended so soon because it would have only improved with more time.\r\n\r\nThe next play, \"Doors,\" is\u00a0written\u00a0by sophomore Charlotte Moffat and directed by junior Sabrina Sonner. The story follows a librarian named Cora, played by junior Riley Cassidy, who has a strange encounter in her quiet, unassuming workplace. A mysterious reoccurring figure, played by freshman Erin Reynolds, claims to be Janus, the Roman god of doors, endings and transitions. The events of the play are rather simple, mostly consisting of Cora's interactions with Janus and her interpretations of them being bounced off her friend, but the conclusion takes a turn for the confusing and intriguing. I don't think I got it entirely, but its crypticness is what made this play special.\r\n\r\n\"Sure Thing\" is the first adapted script of the night, written by David Ives and directed by freshman\u00a0Jason Pollak. The premise is simple: Bill, played by junior Will Kast, attempts to court junior Madison Mignola's character\u00a0Betsy,\u00a0who is reading a book alone in a cafe. Every time either one of them screws up or says something awkward, a girl with an assortment of loud instruments, played by freshman Leanne Miron, interjects with a noise and resets the scene at Bill's last successful chatting point.\r\n\r\nIt's a hilarious script, with plenty of clever gags and a neat, fast pacing. The three actors nailed the timing of their lines and cues, undoubtedly with the help of their director. \"Sure Thing\" could have gone\u00a0poorly very easily, but the dedication to precision and accuracy was what made this adaptation so much fun to watch and my favorite play of the night.\r\n\r\nAfter an intermission, it's time for the next adapted script \"The Six of Calais.\" Written by George Bernard Shaw and directed by senior Aaron Slipper, this play tells the story of the Burghers of Calais (immortalized and exhibited on the Stanford campus by master sculptor Auguste Rodin). The Burghers were six town elders of the French hold Calais, who sacrificed themselves to the English King Edward III, played by freshman\u00a0Johnny Rohrbach, for the safety of their city.\r\n\r\nIt's the longest and biggest play of the night, with a cast of twelve and two Medieval-style war tents flanking the stage. The play is surprisingly humorous for an event typically depicted as somber. Slipper did do the event some dramatic justice throughout his adaptation, especially during the scenes between King Edward and the more defiant Burghers. The only big issue was the projector, which displayed slides of semi-related pieces of art throughout the play. It felt unnecessary and distracting when it overshadowed the performers.\r\n\r\nThe last performance is \"Foul Play,\"\u00a0written by senior Dashiel Grusky and directed by sophomore\u00a0Molly Kraus. It's the most tongue-in-cheek script by far, telling the story of a county fair's best-in-show competition for donkeys. Ryan, played by junior Ido Gal, loves his perfect donkey Harold, played by freshman\u00a0Joey Kellison-Linn, but despises his business associate Rosemary, played by senior Aida Goma-Petite. They have to work together in the most convoluted way possible to defeat Ryan's rival and his schemes involving a parrot. I still don't quite get how a parrot could pass as a donkey and vice versa, but it's the fact that all the characters understand this as a seemingly typical thing that makes it humorous. It was a silly, fun way to end the night.\r\n\r\nThe variety and talent in all the plays is impressive and speaks to the strength of Paly's Theater program and its members. The quick bursts of drama, comedy and intrigue kept me entertained throughout, and it was easily worth the easy two hours it ran for.\r\n\r\nOne Acts are playing again Friday May 2 and Saturday May 3 at 7:30 p.m. in the Haymarket Theater. Tickets cost $5 for students and $7 for adults.","excerpt":"The final show of the year put on by the Palo Alto High School theater program is an impressive display of writing and acting by Paly students and is something everyone and anyone can enjoy.

Photo by Maddy Jones.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 lacrosse team (10-4, 9-1) earned redemption after beating the Gunn High School Titans (12-2, 9-1) in a hard-fought match, 10-9, Wednesday at Paly.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings are now sitting in third place in the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League, while Gunn still holds on to first place.\r\n\r\nDespite the Titans scoring the first two goals of the game, Paly was able to strike back quickly with a goal from sophomore midfielder Maya Benatar, which gave momentum to the Viking offense. Both halfs of the game were toughly contested, with the difference in goals never passing two. While Gunn threatened Paly with fast breaks, the Viking defense stayed patient and blocked several opportunities for a Titan advantage.\r\n\r\nThe cross-town match brought a level of physical aggression that caused both teams to give up key goals due to fouls. Paly senior midfielder Kristen DeStefano scored the last goal of the first half after a Gunn player illegally checked her, resulting in her being sent off of the field with a yellow card.\r\n\r\nWhile defense was a highly emphasised component of this match, both teams excelled offensively, with Titan captain Victoria Nguyen scoring one-third (three) of their goals. Viking junior midfielder Paige Bara responded by scoring an impressive four goals, one of which gave Paly their tenth and winning goal.\r\n\r\nWhile Paly finished the first half with a lead of 7-5, Gunn came back in the 2nd, tying it up 8-8 with 15 minutes to go. During these first 10 minutes, the Titans displayed their athleticism as they pivoted and sprinted with great endurance across the field, waiting for an opening in the Paly defense. Viking sophomore goalie Meredith Kinnaman successfully blocked earlier attempts by the Titan offense, but Gunn\u2019s patience was eventually rewarded, bringing the score to 8-8.\r\n\r\nPaly, determined to put an end to Gunn\u2019s comeback, attentively watched as the Titan\u2019s offense advanced. Gunn midfielders walked back and forth across the field, seemingly taunting the Vikings to make the first move. Paly intercepted the ball and brought it down the field where junior attacker Lauren Gargiulo scored, putting the Vikings back on top.\r\n\r\nIt was apparent that as time on the clock decreased, the intensity increased, as players of both teams desperately fought for possession of the ball. Gunn gained control and in fast break made their way towards the goal, only to be met with fierce opposition by the Viking defense. Almost mechanically, the Gunn offense reset, returning to their style of patience. Gunn midfielder Annie Vesey saw her chance and struck, pivoting and spinning she executed a powerful shot and scored.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was in the moment, it was all instinct,\u201d Vesey said. \u201cAll I was thinking was maybe we can win this.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Viking defense held-off the last attempts of a determined Titan line-up, earning redemption for their loss to Gunn in March.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were not prepared for Gunn\u2019s skills in the first game. This time we knew how they played,\u201d Bara said. \u201cI think we just came into the game with the right mindset and did a much better job communicating on defense.\u201d\r\n\r\nEven though the Vikings walked away with a victory, Coach Jamie Nesbitt is already looking for ways they can improve.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are a lot of areas for improvement,\u201d Nesbitt said. \u201cI think for us, in close games, it comes down to little things like the defensive presence at the end and the urgency to get the ball to the attacking end.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings\u2019 next game is against Saint Francis High School (10-3, 9-1) at 7 p.m. Friday night at Palo Alto High School.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 lacrosse team (10-4, 9-1) earned redemption after beating the Gunn High School Titans (12-2, 9-1) in a hard-fought match, 10-9, Wednesday at Paly.

The Parade is the oldest children\u2019s parade in Northern California. This year\u2019s theme for the event is \u201cLet Me Be Your Neighbor,\u201d according to parade event planner Ali Williams.\r\n\r\nAll of the public middle and high schools of Palo Alto are performing in the parade. During the parade, multiple groups will be marching through the streets, including the Viking Pep Band from Palo Alto High School. The Viking Pep Band will be playing the song \u201cIn the Stone\u201d by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, according to band member and junior Andrew Lu.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got tons of spirit when it comes to playing outside,\u201d Lu said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do yells and cheers, and we have the signature kick during the drum cadence.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile Lu has participated in the Parade in past years for the marching band, he has also attended the event with his family when he was younger, according to Lu.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really great community event [and] brings everyone in town together,\u201d Lu said. \u201cThe groups are diverse, ranging from musicians to martial artists to middle schoolers who\u2019ve built go-carts at school.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring the parade, eight floats are going to compete for the Palo Alto Weekly Awards, along with clowns, stilt walkers, hula artists and other entertainers who will participate\u00a0in the parade. Different schools, youth groups, dance teams and sports teams will also march in the parade, according to Williams.\r\n\r\n\u201cNumerous preschool groups and elementary schools are joining the fun to show school pride,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe parade kicks off with the motorcycle police and ends with the shiny fire engine.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlong with those showing their spirit for the town, there will also be groups who are promoting their organization. The Palo Alto Children\u2019s Theater will be promoting their upcoming performance and the Humane Society will be walking through the parade, showcasing local pets in need. Representatives from the Palo Alto Historical Association will also be riding in the antique cars from the Museum of American Heritage to celebrate its one hundredth anniversary.\r\n\r\nThe parade will end at around noon\u00a0at Heritage Park, where the May Fete Faire will begin. At the park, all of the bands will perform as they arrive. The Faire will also have food trucks and games, according to Williams.\r\n\r\nWilliams stressed the importance of community building within the city.\r\n\r\n\u201c[The event is] a community event that celebrates all that we strive in Palo Alto,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that it\u2019s a place where people care and connect with each other to create a supportive community.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor more information on the event, click <a href=\"www.cityofpaloalto.org\/gov\/depts\/csd\/events\/parade.asp\">here<\/a>.<b>\u00a0<\/b>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto City will host its ninety-second annual May Fete Parade starting at 10 a.m. on Saturday, May 3 at University and Emerson Street.","date":"2014-05-01 14:46:36","author":"Julianna Heron","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/Screen-shot-2014-05-01-at-1.56.43-PM.png","categories":["News"],"tags":{"15095":"fair","15099":"float","15097":"heritage","15098":"heritage park","15093":"may fete","15096":"museum","15094":"parade"}},{"id":71222,"title":"Slideshow: Underclassmen dominate powderpuff","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/05\/01\/slideshow-underclassmen-dominate-powderpuff\/","content":"The annual powderpuff games started yesterday\u00a0with the seniors against the freshmen.
