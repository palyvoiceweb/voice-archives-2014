Due to its large size, the Advanced Journalism class (which publishes the Campanile newspaper) will have first priority to move in to the new building if construction is completed before summer.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIt\u2019ll be fully functional for next year,\u201d Berkson said.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to the ongoing construction of the two new buildings, several small construction projects and changes took place on campus over spring break. These projects included taking down the fences by the east and north side of the campus, relocating trees in the Embarcadero parking lot and adding new walkways between the English building and Library.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThey\u2019re [the construction workers] going to be making adjustments for their next projects,\u201d Berkson said regarding the fences.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Starting next year, students will also have to take the bike path next to the railroad tracks to get to Town and Country Village because there will be construction at the current Embarcadero Road pedestrian crosswalk.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the Media Arts Center and math and social science building construction coming to a close, work on the school\u2019s next projects will be able to begin, according to Berkson.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cNew gym construction will start over the summer, hopefully,\u201d Berkson said.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other upcoming construction plans include remodeling the science building to create four additional classrooms and remodeling the library.<\/p>","excerpt":"Many small construction projects have been carried out over the course of Spring Break, while the new media arts and math buildings are nearing completion.","date":"2014-04-13 17:56:58","author":"Drew Keller","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/photo-1.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8616":"construction","9954":"jerry berkson","11127":"media arts center"}},{"id":70450,"title":"Sophomore and junior testing on Monday","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/13\/sophomore-and-junior-testing-on-monday\/","content":"Palo Alto High School sophomores and juniors will take the\u00a0annual science section of the California Standardized Test and the new Smarter Balanced Test starting at 8:15 a.m. Monday.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dean of Students Craig Tuana, the scores from the Smarter Balanced Test will not count since it is a new online standardized test that the California Department of Education is field testing this year. The results from this year, however, will be examined to make any changes to the scored test that will be administered next year.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Smarter Balance Test is to test students' \u00a0college preparedness, according to Tuana. The Smarter Balance Test is replacing the Early Assessment Program that has been taken annually by juniors in the past. Additionally, Paly has recently changed its common core standards, so this new test will be meeting those new requirements.\r\n\r\nEven though the Smarter Balance Test is not a scored test, this trial will give vulnerable feedback to both Paly and the Department of Education on whether or not online tests of this scale are effective to give at the same time. It will give feedback to teachers as it will reveal if students have learned the material on the test or not, according to Tuana.\r\n\r\n\"[The staff] wants to see if we can handle [the test] and if not, we want to learn from this one to make sure that we can handle it for the test next year,\" Tuana said.\r\n\r\nThe Smarter Balance Test was supposed to have originally been administered to juniors on March 18 and 19, while the sophomores were taking the California High School Exit Examination, but due to the fact that the test was not ready then, the Department of Education decided to postpone its release date.\r\n\r\nThe Smarter Balance Test will be taken on a computer, and it will have a different format than the \u00a0Standardized Testing and Reporting test administered in previous years. \u00a0The test will consist of multiple choice questions, fill-in-the blank questions and even questions which involve drawing on the computer.\r\n\r\n\"[The test will] benefit students who are taking it,\" Tuana said. \"I think this is a wave of future testing that they could possibly experience [this type of testing] in college.\"\r\n\r\nSophomores, on the other hand will be taking the CST. The CST is not a new test. It is a general science test for sophomores, which contains two parts and will end at 10:20 a.m., according to Tuana.\r\n\r\nThe school expects that students will come for both exams like any other standardized test, according to Dean of Students, Craig Tuana.\r\n\r\n\"[The school] really expects the students to come,\" Tuana said. \"We are just asking for two hours of [the students'] time for the tests and to test our system.\"\r\n\r\nWhile sophomores and juniors will have to attend school Monday, freshmen and seniors will have the day off.\r\n\r\nHere is more information about the <a href=\"www.cde.ca.gov\">Smarter Balance Test<\/a>\u00a0and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cde.ca.gov\/ta\/tg\/sr\/cefstar.asp\">CST<\/a>.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cde.ca.gov\/ta\/tg\/sr\/cefstar.asp\">\r\n<\/a>","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School sophomores and juniors will take the annual science section of the California Standardized Test and the new Smarter Balanced Test starting at 8:15 a.m. Monday.","date":"2014-04-13 12:44:32","author":"Julianna Heron","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/test.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"13288":"cst","9760":"juniors","9072":"science","12317":"smarter balance test","9114":"Sophomores","12056":"standardized testing","12319":"test","13289":"testing"}},{"id":70551,"title":"NHSJC Online News Package submission: Feeding the convention","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/11\/nhsjc-online-news-package-submission-feeding-the-convention\/","content":"","excerpt":"Takaaki Sagawa and William Dougall's submission for the National High School Journalism Convention Online News Package contest.","date":"2014-04-11 15:33:47","author":"Takaaki Sagawa","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"id":70388,"title":"Next week dedicated to staff appreciation","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/11\/next-week-dedicated-to-staff-appreciation\/","content":"As second semester begins to dwindle down, Palo Alto High School students will have an opportunity to get on their teachers' good sides with Staff Appreciation Week taking place next week April 14-18.\r\n\r\nAccording to Rebecca Fox, current president of the Parent Student Teacher Association, there will be a latte cart for the staff serving complimentary drinks on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nFox also encouraged students to participate in what she described as a Palo Alto tradition by either sending staff emails or dropping notes into teachers' baskets located in the front office.\r\n\r\n\"We are also encouraging parents and students to write letters of appreciation to teachers and staff,\" Fox said.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Fox said that there will be a luncheon held for staff on Friday.\r\n\r\n\"I certainly think it is well deserved and a good idea,\" Fox said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"As second semester begins to dwindle down, Palo Alto High School students will have an opportunity to get on their teachers' good sides with Staff Appreciation Week taking place next week April 14-18.\r\n","date":"2014-04-11 09:51:48","author":"Matthew Fogarty","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/photo.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":[]},{"id":70392,"title":"Opinion: Put the arrest talk to rest","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/11\/opinion-put-the-arrest-talk-to-rest\/","content":"<p dir=\"ltr\">Human curiosity is a completely normal tendency. So it is not surprising that following the release of a Palo Alto High School senior\u2019s mugshot on several social media sites during the last days of spring break, the Paly community, along with the larger Palo Alto community, became captivated with searching for a better understanding of the situation.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unfortunately, this search has led the community to gossip and make unfounded assumptions about the arrested student and his actions. This tendency has an even greater effect as the discussions are taking place not only on the Quad or between friends, but also in heated discussions online.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The comment sections of websites, such as Facebook in particular, are especially vile as members of the community get heated in their discussions. For example, the mugshot of the student arrested, which the Palo Alto Police Department\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo.php?fbid=664812860221181&amp;set=a.349604361742034.72544.288613124507825&amp;type=1&amp;stream_ref=10\">posted<\/a> on its Facebook page, contains racist and threatening comments and plenty of gossip and speculation. This kind of activity sparks rumors and spreads falsities that can negatively affect this student\u2019s reputation. The student already will face repercussions for his actions, so there is no need to further antagonize the situation.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to social media blasts, there is then the aspect of the face-to-face gossiping that occurs on Paly campus. Over the past week, Paly students have been telling a variety of different versions of the story, which twists the details of the actual occurrences and subsequently leads others to jump to false conclusions. By spreading these falsities the student body unnecessarily adds on to the problems of the student.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While I do not necessarily support the actions of the student, this treatment of the student is simply unacceptable. By resorting to such low methods as gossiping, spreading rumors and racist or threatening remarks, the community is portraying itself in a poor moral-light.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A more appropriate response would have included a way for the student to deal with the repercussions more privately without the community members sticking their noses into and judging the situation. In time, the true events of the situation will become apparent, so spreading false information in the mean time is just pointless. I believe that the Paly community can act much better than we are doing so now. We often pride ourselves on being a progressive and supportive high school and this is our opportunity to prove that we really do fulfill that description.<\/p>","excerpt":"Following the arrest of a Palo Alto high school senior over spring break, the Paly campus leaped into heated discussion.
