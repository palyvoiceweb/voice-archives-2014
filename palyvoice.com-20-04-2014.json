Each day will also be associated with a certain color that the students will be encouraged to wear, according to Hall. The different colors for the days are red, blue, purple, green and rainbow.\r\n\r\nEach day will consist of different activities, including performances and various people coming to talk about the issues being addressed.\u00a0For example, on ability awareness day on Wednesday, Best Buddies is coming to do an activity with the student body. Ada's Cafe, a local business that employs people who are both abled and disabled,\u00a0will be catering on the Quad on that day, too. On the last day, since the color is rainbow, the committee of students running NIOS will be giving shirts to students who will have the opportunity to tie dye them, according to Hall.\r\n\r\n\"This year [we want] to help spark talk about diversity,\" Multicultural Commissioner Ellen Shuan said.\u00a0\"We want to focus on different themes each day\u00a0so we can\u00a0address everything about equality and diversity.\"\r\n\r\nThursday, compassion and action day, is also when the Paly service day is taking place. For the entire\u00a0school day, students will be taking time out of school to go out and help the community.\r\n\r\nPaly Librarian Rachel Kellerman is also creating a <a href=\"http:\/\/libguides.pausd.org\/nios\">LibGuide<\/a> for the teachers during the week. The webpage will include some videos and short discussion questions that correlate with topic of the day, according to School Climate Teacher on Special Assignments,\u00a0Eric Bloom.\r\n\r\n\"Ms. Kellerman has taken on this role in providing some content for teachers to grab onto so that if they feel like they want to spend a little bit of time talking about one of the topics for the day, they can,\" Bloom said. \"The idea is to sneak a little into the class to just start conversations.\"\r\n\r\nThe focus of NIOS this year is to have it mainly student run along with getting more people interested in the topics covered during the week, according to Bloom.\r\n\r\n\"It needs to come from kids who are interested in taking it on,\" Bloom said. \"Not in our schools week is really about developing leadership from the ground up and about empowering students to take over the way that people approach [the problems covered].\"","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School will host its annual Not In Our Schools week beginning Monday during brunch and lunch on the Quad.","date":"2014-04-19 11:22:57","author":"Julianna Heron","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/NIOS1.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"14285":"ability awareness","14287":"action","14284":"anti isms","14289":"awareness","10608":"bloom","14286":"compassion","14278":"equality","14288":"gender sexuality","14282":"hall","14280":"nios","14279":"not in our schools week","14277":"service day","14283":"sexual assault","14281":"shuan"}},{"id":70719,"title":"Police department releases mobile app","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/18\/police-department-releases-mobile-app\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_70721\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"200\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/Palo-Alto-PD-Mobile-app-icon.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-70721 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/Palo-Alto-PD-Mobile-app-icon.jpg\" alt=\"The thumbnail of the PAPD mobile app released on Tuesday.

He has been with me since the beginning, and I think he is the main reason I am as good as I am today.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:<\/strong>Why did you decide to fence in college?\r\n<strong>NB:\u00a0<\/strong>I love fencing, and when I was applying to university, it never crossed my mind that I would not be fencing. Every school I applied to had an NCAA varsity fencing program.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_70671\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"335\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/IMG_0082.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-70671\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/IMG_0082.jpg\" alt=\"Noah Berman walked up to the scoring table at the 2014 NCAA Championships hosted at Ohio State University.

This year I made it to the NCAA championships which were held at Ohio State. \u00a0It was great honor to be one of the top 24 fencers in the country, and validates everything that I have been working on these past 11 years.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:\u00a0<\/strong>What has been your favorite moment and\/or biggest accomplishment in your fencing career?\r\n<strong>NB:\u00a0<\/strong>My biggest accomplishment in my fencing career is undoubtedly going to the NCAA championships.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:\u00a0<\/strong>What was it like to compete in the NCAA championship?\r\n<strong>NB:\u00a0<\/strong>The championships were so amazing because of the attention to detail that was placed on them. Everything was run smoothly. There were top notch referees from around the country who were flown in. This is also such a great tournament because there will never be another time where I get to fence 23 other people at the same time who are at such a high caliber in terms of skill.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:\u00a0<\/strong>What are the major differences between high school and collegiate fencing?\r\n<strong>NB:\u00a0<\/strong>Fencing not in college is composed of a pool round where you fence six other people to five touches [when the tip of one fencer's weapon touches the target area of the opponent]. After that, you are placed in a direct elimination bracket just like March Madness where you get a seed and need to win to move on. \u00a0In the DE [direct elimination] you fence to 15 touches.\r\nCollege is different, because there are no 15 point bouts. At each tournament, you fence multiple schools and you fence three to five opponents from each school.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV:\u00a0<\/strong>Do you have any advice for current Paly or high school athletes?\r\n<strong>NB:\u00a0<\/strong>Make sure that you are doing a sport that you love. When I was growing up, a stick was always a sword to me, and I think that is one of the main reasons I have done so well in my fencing career. Just as with anything else in life, if you are not fully committed to your sport, you are never going to reach your full potential.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_70674\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"458\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/IMG_40581.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-70674\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/IMG_40581.jpg\" alt=\"Noah Berman won a duel against an opponent from Duke University.

Many of the examples in the Weekly story are related by a staff member or parent who claimed to have seen the situations unfold.\r\n\r\nThere is now push back on social media from some students who saw no misconduct from Winston during his time at Paly.\r\n\r\n\"This Winston story is completely a misrepresentation of Mr. Winston as a guy,\" junior Phil Lewis said. \"I had the pleasure of knowing him well, and he really cared about each individual. It's a shame that he was forced to leave Paly because now the students are stuck with a misconception of him as a person.\"\r\n\r\nNot only current students, but also Paly alumni, disagree with the claims made about Winston.\r\n\r\n\"During my time at Paly I never witnessed Mr. Winston doing or saying anything inappropriate,\" said Paly alum Olivia Maggi, Class of 2013. \"He would always talk to students and was very friendly, but I thought that was good. I thought he was very involved with students' lives and cared about how they were doing. It made me feel like he actually cared and supported us. When I read the Weekly's story about Mr. Winston, it made me sad that this could happen to him. I feel that words can sometimes be taken the wrong way and that Mr. Winston was never intending to be inappropriate. I think he was very good at his job.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, now some students said they felt uncomfortable with Winston after reading the article.\r\n\r\n\"Honestly, I was pretty on board with the 'Chill Phil' thing, too,\" senior Jessica Feinberg said. \"After reading the evidence and documentation against him and having discussions with teachers and fellow students, I feel a really sick sense of being used. He created a good rapport with students ... but he used that as a shield to protect him from these allegations because it became nearly impossible for students and teachers to report their harassment. His popularity among students \u2014 this shield \u2014 allowed a culture of silence to be created, where speaking up would create backlash against those who spoke. And I was part of that shield.\"\r\n\r\nWinston argued against\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/media\/reports\/1397016468.pdf\">six specific allegations<\/a>\u00a0made against him by sending a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/media\/reports\/1397016279.pdf\">letter<\/a> to Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources Scott Bowers on June 14, according to the Weekly.\r\n\r\n\"It is always disappointing when statements or conduct are misinterpreted, but I understand that this is going to happen from time to time, and I do my best to avoid such misinterpretations,\" Winston said to Bowers. \"I am certain I can do still better in that respect and I will take these comments as a learning experience that will help me further improve.\"","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School students are responding to a Palo Alto Weekly story detailing former Paly Principal Phil Winston's notice of misconduct, which was received by him last summer.","date":"2014-04-15 14:20:07","author":"Lydia Barry","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/30980_main.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8939":"palo alto","8953":"paly","8984":"Phil Winston","9013":"principal","11609":"resignation","13859":"student response"}},{"id":70630,"title":"Preview: New York Times bestselling author to discuss college life","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/15\/preview-new-york-times-bestselling-author-to-discuss-college-life\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School Parent Teacher Student Associations are bringing a New York Times bestselling author to Gunn's Spangenberg Theater\u00a0tonight at 7 p.m.\u00a0to discuss students' transitions to college.\r\n\r\nHarlan Cohen, author of the student handbook on college life\u00a0<em>The Naked Roommate,<\/em>\u00a0will hold a free presentation for seniors, juniors and parents in preparation for their upcoming move to college and for the college search process, according to PTSA parent Jennifer Landesmann.\r\n\r\nCohen encourages asking questions, so the audience will be able to text in their questions about any topic concerning the college experience, including making friends, relationships, peer pressure, time management and finances, according to a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/archive.constantcontact.com\/fs164\/1102270631099\/archive\/1117083571959.html\" target=\"_blank\">PTSA Paly Link email<\/a>.\r\n\r\nCollege advisor Sandra Cernobori praised Cohen's presentation skills.\r\n\r\n\"His book is good, and he's engaging and entertaining,\" Cernobori said.\r\n\r\nCohen has visited more than 400 college campuses and has written five books, according to his\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.NakedRoommate.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a>.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School Parent Teacher Student Associations are bringing a New York Times bestselling author to Gunn's Spangenberg Theater tonight at 7 p.m. to discuss students' transitions to college.","date":"2014-04-15 14:05:56","author":"Lizzie Chun","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/image_4.jpeg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"14165":"cernobori","14162":"harlan cohen","14163":"new york times","9019":"PTSA","14164":"the naked roommate"}},{"id":70582,"title":"Voice of the Week: Erik Olah","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/15\/voice-of-the-week-erik-olah\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_70587\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"576\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/erik-olah.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-70587 \" alt=\"erik olah\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/erik-olah.jpg\" width=\"576\" height=\"432\" \/><\/a> Palo Alto High School science teacher Erik Olah poses outside his home at Paly, the science building.

How would you describe yourself in three words?<\/p>\r\nErik Olah: I hate questions like that. Describe myself in three words? Well if you know if someone repeats the question they're totally stalling. We can come back to that.\r\n\r\nTPV: What's your favorite marine animal?\r\n\r\nEO: Probably the northern elephant seal. There's a difference between northern and southern elephant seals. There's a big difference.\r\n\r\nTPV: Why the northern?\r\n\r\nEO: Well that's the one I studied when I did my studying of marine biology at Santa Cruz. I observed and studied northern elephant seals quite a bit. They're not that different than southern elephant seals, but they are the one's that I've seen.\r\n\r\nPV: How do you like teaching seniors?\r\n\r\nEO: Oh, it's interesting. Seniors are fine, I'm used to it. It's my third year teaching seniors so you start getting used to the pattern. \u00a0You kind of see them fall out, some sooner than others, some depending on when they get into college. But usually by this time of year the vast majority are checked out, so it's hard to keep them focused. But that's why with Marine Biology [class] I do marine mammals now, because I think that's the thing people are most interested in, so I try to do the thing people are most interested in when it's most likely they will be checked out of the class.\r\n\r\nPV: What do you like better, marine biology or AP biology?\r\n\r\nEO: That's a tough question. Marine biology is my class, I designed it, I'm the only one's who's teaching it. It's my thing, so that would be the thing I am most excited to do and always thinking about. AP biology is great too, I am really enjoying that.\r\n\r\nPV: When you go to the aquarium what's your favorite animal to see?\r\n\r\nEO: I used to really like sea otters, but they are always there. I don't know if it's my favorite but I always like looking at the sunfish because it's like what the heck, what is that thing? It doesn't look like a thing that should be. I don't think it's my favorite, but I like seeing it and noticing how ridiculous it looks. Also, all the parasites that are on it usually.\r\n\r\nPV: Any words on the Paly boys' basketball season?\r\n\r\nEO: Pretty good season. We had a lot of seniors graduate last year, so pretty much all the guys on this year's team had zero varsity basketball experience. Expectations might have been a little bit lower, but they definitely way overachieved and they did quite well. I think they definitely overachieved. It was a fun year.\r\n\r\nPV: You have a pretty popular Twitter feed that's well-read among the Paly students. Anything to say about that?\r\n\r\nEO: Is it that well-read?\r\n\r\nPV: You were just featured in the Verde.\r\n\r\nEO: I'm always featured in the Verde. I don't know. My thing with it is I know some teachers use it as a teaching tool, and I've thought about that, but you have Schoology for all your work stuff and you can look for that there so I just try to use it as an outlet to connect with students in a more fun way. If kids think it's funny that's great. I try to say a few things here and there that are funny.\r\n\r\nPV: What's your favorite marine-biology-themed pun?\r\n\r\nEO: Whale, I don't know. Let me sea if I can think of one. I otter do better than that.\r\n\r\nPV: You recently helped a student ask another student to Prom. Do you like to stay pretty involved with the student community?\r\n\r\nEO: It was fun. I went to Gunn and I don't remember people doing those crazy fun things like that, so I think it was kind of fun to experience that. I mean I didn't ask the person, but it was fun to be a part of that experience.\r\n\r\nPV: Did you go to Prom?\r\n\r\nEO: I went to my junior Prom but not my senior Prom.\r\n\r\nPV: Did you ask the girl?\r\n\r\nEO: I don't remember. I think I didn't. I know one of the Homecomings, actually both of the Homecomings, I went to I didn't, the girl asked me. I was kind of lazy about that. But to backtrack, I didn't go to my senior Prom because my sister's college graduation was the same weekend. It's not because I couldn't get a date, I'm sure there were plenty of offers. Back to the Prom thing, it was fun. It was fun because it was a student I really liked so it was fun to give her a funny experience that she hopefully remembers. But that's not the only one I did. I did a pop quiz question for a kid up on the projector. Another kid came in and sang, but I wasn't really part of that.\r\n\r\nPV: If you had one thing to say to the Voice audience, what would you want to say?\r\n\r\nEO: I know that Paly can be stressful and that high school is stressful, but try to find the things you enjoy and focus on the positive and get the most out of those things.\r\n\r\nPV: Specifically to seniors?\r\n\r\nEO: Good luck. For the seniors, I feel like the college process is so stressful that it takes the fun out of getting into college, but I hope once fall rolls around you realize what a great opportunity you have. It's fun, and you have a good opportunity to learn a lot. There's so much you can get out of college. I hope you can get past the frustrations that are happening now and get to the good stuff.\r\n\r\nPV: That's really nice.\r\n\r\nEO: I can be really nice.\r\n\r\n<em>If you know a student (or student group) who you think should be interviewed, please leave a comment below.<\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"This week The Paly Voice sat down with science teacher Erik Olah to talk about northern elephant seals, Prom and Twitter.\r\n","date":"2014-04-15 13:31:47","author":"Kate Marinkovich","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/erik-olah.jpg","categories":["Features","Spotlight","Voice of the Week"],"tags":{"13930":"erik olah","8953":"paly","10258":"voice of the week"}}]
